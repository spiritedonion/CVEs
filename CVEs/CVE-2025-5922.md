## Security Advisory: Critical Vulnerability in TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool (CVE-2025-5922)

We are issuing an urgent alert regarding a newly identified security vulnerability in the **TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool**. This flaw could potentially allow an unauthorized individual with local access to a system to gain access to the administration console, posing a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of your remote access infrastructure. For businesses relying on TSplus for remote access, this could mean unauthorized configuration changes, data exposure, or system compromise.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-5922**
*   **Affected Software:** TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   All versions below **v18.40.6.17**
    *   LTS (Long-Term Support) versions below **v17.2025.6.27**
    *   LTS (Long-Term Support) versions below **v16.2025.6.27**

The vulnerability stems from how the TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool handles its PIN code, which is designed to restrict access to administrators. In affected versions, the hash of this PIN code is stored in a system registry location that is accessible to regular, non-administrative users. Crucially, this hash is stored without "salting," a cryptographic technique that adds random data to the input of a hashing function.

Without salting, the stored hash is susceptible to offline brute-force attacks, including the use of pre-computed "rainbow tables." An attacker with local access to the system can extract this unsalted hash from the registry and, given sufficient time and resources, reverse it to discover the original PIN code.

While no specific payload or path is required for exploitation beyond local system access, the process involves:

1.  Gaining local user-level access to the system running TSplus.
2.  Accessing the system registry to retrieve the unsalted PIN hash.
3.  Performing an offline brute-force or rainbow table attack on the extracted hash to determine the PIN.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker with local, non-administrative access to bypass the PIN protection of the TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool. Gaining access to the admin tool could enable an attacker to:

*   Modify server configurations.
*   Alter user access permissions.
*   Potentially disrupt services.
*   Gain further access to the network or sensitive data, depending on the server's role and other existing vulnerabilities.

The CVSS 4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is **4.8 (MEDIUM)**. While requiring local access, the ability to circumvent an administrative access control mechanism makes this a serious concern.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual using **TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool** is at risk if they are running an affected version. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Businesses utilizing TSplus for remote employee access.
*   IT departments managing servers with TSplus installed.
*   Managed Service Providers (MSPs) using TSplus for client access.

### Recommendations

**Immediate action is advised for all TSplus users.**

#### For System Administrators and IT Teams:

*   **Update Immediately:** The most critical action is to update your TSplus Remote Access installation to a patched version without delay.
    *   For standard versions, update to **v18.40.6.17** or higher.
    *   For LTS versions, update to **v17.2025.6.27** or **v16.2025.6.27** or higher.
*   **Review Access Controls:** Ensure that physical and logical access to servers running TSplus is strictly controlled and monitored. This vulnerability requires local access, so limiting who can log in to the server locally is crucial.
*   **Least Privilege:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege for all users on your systems.

#### For TSplus Developers (already addressed):

*   The vendor has addressed this vulnerability. Future development should ensure that sensitive information like PINs or passwords are:
    *   **Properly Hashed and Salted:** Always use strong, modern hashing algorithms with a unique, cryptographically secure salt for each password or PIN.
    *   **Stored Securely:** Store hashed credentials in locations inaccessible to regular users, even with local access.
