## Critical Security Alert: Stored XSS Vulnerability in GLPI (CVE-2025-27514)

### Introduction

A newly identified security vulnerability in **GLPI**, a widely used Free Asset and IT Management Software, poses a significant risk to organizations utilizing affected versions. This flaw, if exploited, could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, system compromise, and disruption of IT operations, potentially resulting in data breaches, financial losses, and damage to reputation.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-27514**
*   **Affected Software:** **GLPI** (Free Asset and IT Management Software)
*   **Affected Versions:** **GLPI** versions **9.5.0** through **10.0.18**
*   **Technical Cause:** This vulnerability is a **stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw. An authenticated user with "technician" privileges can inject a malicious payload into the project's kanban board. This malicious script is then stored within the GLPI application and will execute whenever another user, including administrators, views the compromised kanban board.
*   **Example Vulnerable Context:** The vulnerability resides in how GLPI processes and displays information within the project's kanban. An attacker could embed a script within a field that is rendered without proper sanitization, for example, within a task description or project name, which then executes when viewed.
    *   *Conceptual Payload (for illustrative purposes):* `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` or more sophisticated scripts to steal session cookies.

### Risk Description

Exploitation of this **stored XSS vulnerability** could allow an attacker to:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Steal session cookies from other users, including high-privilege administrators. This could grant the attacker full control over the compromised user's account without needing their password.
*   **Data Theft:** Access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data managed within GLPI, such as asset inventories, user details, IT tickets, or confidential project information.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Perform actions within GLPI in the context of the compromised user, such as creating new users, modifying system configurations, or escalating privileges.
*   **Defacement/Malware Distribution:** Inject malicious content that could deface the application interface or redirect users to malicious websites.

Given that GLPI is an IT management tool, a successful attack could severely compromise an organization's IT infrastructure, data integrity, and operational security.

### Who is at Risk?

Organizations, businesses, and IT departments that use **GLPI** for asset management, IT service desk, or ITIL operations are at risk, specifically if they are running any version from **9.5.0** up to and including **10.0.18**. This includes any instance where multiple users, especially administrators, interact with the project kanban feature.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and IT Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** The most critical action is to update your **GLPI** installation to version **10.0.19** or higher immediately. This version contains the patch that remediates the vulnerability.
    *   Follow the official **GLPI** update instructions carefully to ensure a smooth upgrade process and data integrity.
*   **Monitor User Activity:** Regularly review activity logs for unusual behavior, especially related to technician accounts or modifications within project boards.
*   **Implement Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that users, including technicians, only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their job functions.

**For Developers (General Guidance):**

*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:** Always validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before processing and storing it. Crucially, encode all output that is rendered back to the user's browser, especially in areas like dashboards, reports, and project views, to prevent script execution.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Adhere to secure coding guidelines to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and insecure direct object references. Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.
