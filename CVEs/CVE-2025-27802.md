## Urgent Security Advisory: Critical Stored XSS Vulnerability in Optimizely CMS (CVE-2025-27802)

A significant security vulnerability has been discovered in the **Optimizely Content Management System (CMS)**, formerly known as Episerver CMS. This flaw, a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability, presents a critical risk that could lead to unauthorized data access, website defacement, or even broader system compromise for organizations using affected versions.

For businesses, this vulnerability translates directly into potential reputational damage, financial loss from downtime or incident response, and regulatory compliance breaches due to data exposure. Immediate action is advised to mitigate these risks.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-27802**
*   **Affected Software:** **Episerver Content Management System (CMS) by Optimizely**
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Version 11.X: `EPiServer.CMS.Core` prior to `11.21.4` with `EPiServer.CMS.UI` prior to `11.37.5`
    *   Version 12.X: `EPiServer.CMS.Core` prior to `12.22.1` with `EPiServer.CMS.UI` prior to `11.37.3`
*   **Technical Cause:**
    This vulnerability is categorized as a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw. It specifically impacts the Rich Text Editor (RTE) properties found within the CMS's "Edit" section. These text fields, which are used for content input, failed to adequately sanitize user-supplied data. This oversight allowed an authenticated attacker, holding at least a "WebEditor" role, to inject malicious JavaScript code directly into stored content.

    When a legitimate user (such as another editor or administrator) subsequently views the compromised page—for example, in a preview mode or during content review—the injected malicious JavaScript code executes within their browser.

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of this **Stored XSS** vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

*   **Steal sensitive information:** This includes session cookies, which could enable an attacker to impersonate logged-in users, including administrators, and gain unauthorized access to the CMS.
*   **Deface website content:** Malicious code could alter page appearance, inject misleading information, or display unwanted advertisements to legitimate visitors.
*   **Redirect users:** Visitors could be covertly redirected to phishing sites or other malicious web pages.
*   **Install malware:** Attackers might leverage this vulnerability to force users to download malware, potentially compromising their systems.
*   **Compromise the CMS:** In severe scenarios, privilege escalation attacks could occur, leading to full control over the CMS platform.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization utilizing **Optimizely CMS** (formerly Episerver CMS) is at risk if they are running any of the affected versions specified above. This includes a wide range of companies that manage their websites, intranets, or digital experiences through this platform, especially where multiple content editors or users with "WebEditor" roles interact with the CMS.

### Recommendations

**For Developers & IT Teams:**

*   **Patch Immediately:** The most critical step is to update your Optimizely CMS installations to the latest secure versions.
    *   For **Version 11.X**: Update `EPiServer.CMS.Core` to `11.21.4` or higher, and `EPiServer.CMS.UI` to `11.37.5` or higher.
    *   For **Version 12.X**: Update `EPiServer.CMS.Core` to `12.22.1` or higher, and `EPiServer.CMS.UI` to `11.37.3` or higher.
*   **Implement Robust Input Validation:** Beyond patching, ensure that all user-supplied input, especially within rich text editors, undergoes thorough server-side sanitization and encoding to prevent any form of script injection.
*   **Enforce Least Privilege:** Review and strictly enforce user permissions. Limit access and roles to only what is absolutely necessary for each user's function, particularly for content editors.

**For Website Owners/Admins:**

*   **Prioritize Updates:** Contact your internal IT department or external development partners immediately to schedule and implement the necessary Optimizely CMS updates. This is a critical security measure.
*   **Backup Data:** Always perform a full backup of your CMS data and configurations before initiating any major updates.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Remain vigilant for any unusual modifications to website content or unexpected user behaviors in your CMS logs.
