## Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8: Critical Password Exposure Vulnerability

A newly identified vulnerability in the **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8** could lead to unauthorized access and significant privacy risks for device owners. This critical issue allows an attacker with brief physical access to the dashcam to easily steal the device's password, compromising user data, recorded footage, and potentially the integrity of the system.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-30124**
*   **Affected Software:** **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF**
*   **Affected Version:** Specifically confirmed in **version 2.0.8**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the dashcam's password. When a new SD card is inserted into the device, the existing password for the dashcam is automatically written onto the SD card in **cleartext** (unencrypted, readable form).
*   **Exploitation Scenario:** An attacker could:
    1.  Gain temporary physical access to the dashcam.
    2.  Insert a new, blank SD card into the device.
    3.  Remove the SD card.
    4.  Access the SD card on another device to read the dashcam's password directly from the card.

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to steal the dashcam's administrator password. With this password, an attacker could gain full unauthorized control over the dashcam, potentially:

*   Viewing sensitive recorded footage, which may contain private information.
*   Modifying device settings, including disabling critical security features.
*   Gaining access to linked cloud services or associated accounts if passwords are reused.
*   Causing data loss or integrity issues by formatting or manipulating the SD card.

This poses a significant privacy and security risk for any individual or organization using these devices.

### Who is at Risk

Any individual or organization currently using a **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF version 2.0.8** is at risk. This vulnerability requires temporary physical access to the device, making it a particular concern for vehicles left unattended or in easily accessible locations.

### Recommendations

**For Marbella (Developers):**
*   **Immediate Patching:** Prioritize the development and release of a firmware update that addresses this insecure password storage. Passwords should never be stored or written in **cleartext**, especially to removable media.
*   **Secure Password Handling:** Implement robust encryption for all sensitive data at rest and in transit. Ensure that secure password handling protocols are followed throughout the device's lifecycle.
*   **Secure Boot & Authentication:** Consider implementing stronger authentication mechanisms and secure boot processes in future firmware versions to enhance overall device security.

**For Dashcam Owners/Admins:**
*   **Secure Physical Access:** Whenever possible, ensure your dashcam is not left unattended in easily accessible locations. If feasible, remove the device from your vehicle when parked in an unsecured area.
*   **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the official Marbella website for firmware updates specific to your `KR8s Dashcam FF` model. Install any security patches immediately upon their release.
*   **Password Hygiene:** While a firmware fix is pending, be aware that changing the password *after* an SD card has been inserted will write the *new* password to *that specific* SD card. Always use strong, unique passwords for your dashcam.
*   **SD Card Security:** Be mindful of who has access to your SD cards after they have been in the dashcam, as they may contain the cleartext password.
