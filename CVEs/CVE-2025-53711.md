## New Denial-of-Service Vulnerability Discovered in **TP-Link TL-WR841N V11** Routers

A significant security vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-53711**, has been discovered in **TP-Link TL-WR841N V11** wireless routers. This flaw, assigned a CVSS v4.0 Base Score of **6.9 (Medium)**, could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering affected devices inoperable and severely disrupting network connectivity. For businesses and individuals relying on these devices, a successful exploit means a complete loss of internet access or internal network services, directly impacting operations, productivity, and potentially leading to financial losses.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-53711**
*   **Affected Software:** **TP-Link TL-WR841N V11** router firmware.
*   **Version Numbers Affected:** Specifically affects **TP-Link TL-WR841N V11** hardware revisions. It is crucial to note that this vulnerability impacts products that are no longer supported by the manufacturer.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input parameter validation within the `/userRpm/WlanNetworkRpm.htm` file. An attacker can send specially crafted input to this endpoint, triggering a buffer overflow. This overflow causes the device's web service to crash, leading to the denial-of-service state. The attack can be launched remotely.
*   **Vulnerable Path:** `/userRpm/WlanNetworkRpm.htm`

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the **TP-Link TL-WR841N V11** router. This means the device will become unresponsive, preventing users from accessing the internet or their local network services through the router. This can lead to significant downtime, loss of productivity, and disruption of critical business operations that rely on network connectivity.

### Who is at Risk

Organizations and individuals currently using **TP-Link TL-WR841N V11** routers are at risk. Given that the manufacturer no longer supports these devices, there will be no official patch released. This makes the risk particularly high for users who have deployed these routers in critical environments or who have not upgraded their legacy networking hardware.

### Recommendations

Immediate action is required for those using the affected devices:

*   **Discontinue Use:** The primary recommendation is to immediately discontinue the use of **TP-Link TL-WR841N V11** routers. As these devices are no longer supported, no security patches will be provided.
*   **Replace Hardware:** Replace affected routers with newer, supported models from reputable vendors. Prioritize devices that receive regular security updates and patches.
*   **Network Segmentation/Isolation (if unavoidable):** If immediate replacement is not possible, consider isolating the affected router on a segmented network, limiting its exposure to the internet and internal networks. However, this is a temporary and partial mitigation for an unsupported device.
*   **Monitor Network Traffic:** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns targeting the router's web interface, which could indicate an attempted exploit.
