## Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability Discovered in Gandia Integra Total of TESI

A severe security flaw has been identified in **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**, presenting a critical risk to organizations utilizing this software. This vulnerability could lead to significant data breaches, unauthorized system access, and potential operational disruption, underscoring the urgent need for action to protect sensitive information and maintain business continuity.

### Vulnerability Details

This newly disclosed vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-41371**, is a **SQL Injection** flaw found in **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** versions **2.1.2217.3 through 4.4.2236.1**.

A SQL Injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate database queries by injecting malicious code into input fields. In this case, an authenticated attacker can exploit the `'idestudio'` parameter within the `/encuestas/integraweb_v4/integra/html/view/acceso.php` path. This manipulation allows them to execute arbitrary commands against the underlying database.

The vulnerability has been rated with a **CVSS Base Score of 9.3 (Critical)**, indicating its severe impact and ease of exploitation.

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability grants an attacker extensive control over your database. This includes the ability to:

*   **Retrieve sensitive data:** Access and exfiltrate all information stored in the database, such as personal user data, financial records, or proprietary business intelligence.
*   **Create, update, and delete data:** Tamper with existing records, insert malicious data, or even wipe entire databases, leading to data integrity issues or complete data loss.
*   **Achieve system compromise:** In certain configurations, SQL injection can be leveraged to execute commands on the server itself, potentially leading to full system compromise and the installation of malware or backdoors.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or entity currently using **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** within the affected version range (**2.1.2217.3 to 4.4.2236.1**) is immediately at risk. This includes businesses, educational institutions, or other entities that rely on this specific software for their operations.

Immediate action is crucial to mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability:

**For Developers & IT Teams:**
*   **Patch Immediately:** Apply any official patches or updates released by TESI/Gandia Integra that address **CVE-2025-41371**.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and parameterized queries for all user-supplied data to prevent SQL injection attacks. Never trust user input.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that database accounts used by the application have only the minimum necessary permissions.

**For Website Owners & Administrators:**
*   **Update Software:** Contact your vendor or system administrator to inquire about and apply the latest secure version of **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** as soon as it becomes available.
*   **Monitor Systems:** Actively monitor your systems for any unusual activity or signs of compromise, especially within database logs.
*   **Temporary Mitigation (If No Patch):** If an immediate patch is not available, consider implementing Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to filter and block suspicious SQL injection attempts against the `/encuestas/integraweb_v4/integra/html/view/acceso.php` path and the `'idestudio'` parameter. Restricting access to the affected system from untrusted networks may also offer temporary relief.
