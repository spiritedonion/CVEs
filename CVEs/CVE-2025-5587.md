A critical security vulnerability has been identified in the **Appzend theme** for WordPress.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-5587**
*   **Affected Software:** **Appzend theme** for WordPress
*   **Versions Affected:** All versions up to, and including, **1.2.6**
*   **Technical Cause:** This vulnerability is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw. It originates from inadequate input sanitization and output escaping of the `progressbarLayout` parameter.
*   **Exploitation:** An authenticated attacker, even with basic **Contributor-level access** or higher, can inject malicious web scripts into pages. These scripts are then stored in your website's database.

---

### Risk Description

When a legitimate user, including an administrator, views a page containing the injected malicious code, the script will automatically execute within their web browser. This can lead to a range of severe consequences, including:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal administrative session cookies, gaining full control over your website.
*   **Website Defacement:** Malicious content can be displayed on your site, harming your brand.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive user data accessible in the browser (e.g., session tokens, personal information) can be stolen.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Visitors could be redirected to malicious websites or tricked into downloading malware.
*   **Administrator Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might be able to create new admin users or modify existing content.

---

### Who is at Risk?

Any WordPress website currently using the **Appzend theme** in version **1.2.6** or any older version is highly susceptible to this vulnerability. Websites that allow multiple authenticated users, particularly those with Contributor-level roles or higher, face an elevated risk.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners/Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** The most critical step is to update your **Appzend theme** to the latest available version as soon as possible. Check your WordPress dashboard for theme updates.
*   **User Role Review:** Temporarily restrict or carefully review the permissions of Contributor-level users and above, especially if they have access to modify content that utilizes the `progressbarLayout` parameter, until your theme is updated.
*   **Security Scans:** Conduct a thorough security scan of your website after updating to ensure no malicious scripts were previously injected and remain active.

**For Developers:**

*   **Input Sanitization:** Ensure all user-supplied input, especially for parameters like `progressbarLayout`, is rigorously sanitized using functions like `wp_kses()` to remove potentially malicious code before it's stored in the database.
*   **Output Escaping:** Always escape all data before rendering it in the browser. Use appropriate WordPress escaping functions such as `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, or `esc_url()` to prevent XSS attacks.
