## Critical Authorization Bypass in AutoGPT Exposes AI Agent Data

For organizations leveraging AI agents and platforms like **AutoGPT**, safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of AI operations is paramount. A newly discovered vulnerability in **AutoGPT** could expose sensitive AI agent execution results, posing a significant risk of data exposure and potential operational compromise for businesses relying on this platform.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical authorization bypass vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-53944**, has been discovered in **AutoGPT** versions **v0.6.15 and below**.

This flaw resides in the external API's `get_graph_execution_results` endpoint. While the system correctly validates user access to the `graph_id` parameter, it critically fails to verify ownership or authorization for the `graph_exec_id` parameter. This oversight allows any authenticated user to access the execution results of any AI agent by simply providing an arbitrary execution ID. The issue is exacerbated because the internal API correctly implements full validation for both parameters, indicating an external API-specific oversight.

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-53944**
*   **Affected Software:** **AutoGPT**
*   **Affected Versions:** **v0.6.15 and below**
*   **Technical Detail:** Authorization bypass in the external API endpoint `/get_graph_execution_results` due to insufficient validation of the `graph_exec_id` parameter.
*   **Example:** An authenticated user could potentially request data for an execution they don't own by manipulating the `graph_exec_id` in a request like:
    `GET /api/v1/get_graph_execution_results?graph_id=your_graph_id&graph_exec_id=arbitrary_execution_id`

### Risk Description

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to the execution results of any AI agent running on the **AutoGPT** platform. This could lead to:

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** AI agent outputs, process logs, and intermediate data could be viewed by unauthorized parties.
*   **Operational Intelligence Gathering:** Attackers could gain insights into an organization's AI agent activities, strategies, or proprietary data processing, potentially compromising business secrets.
*   **Compliance Breaches:** Depending on the nature of the data processed by the AI agents, unauthorized access could lead to significant data privacy and regulatory compliance violations.

### Who is at Risk

Organizations and individuals who have deployed or are using **AutoGPT** instances, particularly those running versions **v0.6.15 or older**, are immediately at risk. This includes anyone using **AutoGPT** to manage sensitive AI agents or process confidential information within their operations.

### Recommendations

**For Developers and IT Teams:**

*   **Immediate Patching:** Upgrade your **AutoGPT** installations to **version 0.6.16** or newer without delay. This version contains the necessary fix.
*   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough security code reviews, especially on external API endpoints, to ensure robust authorization and ownership validation for all input parameters.
*   **Implement Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that API access tokens and user roles have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their functions.

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Update AutoGPT:** Verify your current **AutoGPT** version and update to **v0.6.16** immediately.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Increase vigilance on API access logs for the `get_graph_execution_results` endpoint, looking for unusual access patterns or requests attempting to access unauthorized `graph_exec_id` values.
*   **Review Access Controls:** Periodically review and strengthen user authentication and authorization policies for your **AutoGPT** deployment to limit access to authorized personnel only.
