## Security Alert: Critical Data Exposure Vulnerability in RevelaCode (CVE-2025-54428)

We are issuing an urgent security alert regarding a critical vulnerability discovered in **RevelaCode** software. This flaw, identified as **CVE-2025-54428**, could lead to unauthorized access to your databases, potentially resulting in **data exfiltration, modification, or deletion**. Immediate action is strongly recommended to protect your systems and sensitive information.

### Introduction

In today's digital landscape, the security of sensitive data is paramount. A breach can lead to significant financial loss, reputational damage, regulatory penalties, and a severe erosion of trust with customers and stakeholders. This vulnerability directly impacts the confidentiality and integrity of your database content, making it a high-priority concern for all users of **RevelaCode**.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-54428**
*   **Affected Software:** **RevelaCode** (an AI-powered faith-tech project)
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to **1.0.1**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an accidental exposure of sensitive database connection details. In **RevelaCode** versions below 1.0.1, a valid **MongoDB Atlas URI** – which embeds the database username and password – was inadvertently committed to a public code repository. This means the credentials needed to access your databases were publicly accessible to anyone.
*   **Example of Exposed Information:**
    The type of information publicly exposed is similar to this structure, containing direct access credentials:
    `mongodb+srv://<database_user>:<database_password>@<cluster_address>/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

### Risk Description

An attacker could leverage the publicly exposed **MongoDB Atlas URI** to gain full, unauthorized access to your **RevelaCode** production or staging databases. This exploitation could lead to several severe consequences:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could steal sensitive user data, proprietary business information, or any other critical data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification or Deletion:** Malicious actors could tamper with your database contents, corrupting or deleting vital information, leading to operational disruption and data integrity issues.
*   **System Compromise:** Database access could potentially be used as a stepping stone to further compromise other parts of your IT infrastructure.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual using the **RevelaCode** software is at risk, especially if running versions older than **1.0.1**. If your **RevelaCode** instance connects to a MongoDB Atlas database, and your credentials were part of the exposed repository, your data is directly vulnerable.

### Recommendations

We strongly urge all users of **RevelaCode** to take the following actions immediately:

**For All Users and System Administrators:**

*   **Rotate Database Credentials Immediately:** This is the most critical step. Change the username and password for the exposed MongoDB Atlas database user without delay. This will invalidate any publicly exposed credentials.
*   **Audit Access Logs:** Thoroughly review recent access logs for your MongoDB Atlas instance for any suspicious or unauthorized login attempts or activities.

**For Developers and IT Teams:**

*   **Update Software:** Upgrade your **RevelaCode** instance to version **1.0.1** as soon as possible. This version contains the fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Implement Secret Management:** Transition away from hardcoding sensitive credentials directly in code. Adopt industry-standard secret management solutions such as Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Secret Manager. These tools provide secure storage and access to sensitive information, preventing such exposures.
*   **Enhance Secure Development Practices:** Integrate rigorous code review processes and automated security testing tools into your development pipeline to proactively identify and prevent similar credential exposures and other security flaws.
