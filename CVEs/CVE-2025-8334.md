## Critical Security Vulnerability Discovered in Campcodes Online Recruitment Management System 1.0

A critical security flaw has been identified in the **Campcodes Online Recruitment Management System version 1.0**. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to organizations using this software, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive applicant data, system compromise, and disruption of recruitment operations. Immediate action is advised to protect your systems and data.

### Why This Matters

For any organization handling recruitment, the integrity and confidentiality of applicant data are paramount. A compromise of your recruitment system could expose personally identifiable information (PII), lead to compliance violations, erode trust with candidates, and result in significant financial and reputational damage. This vulnerability, being remotely exploitable and publicly disclosed, presents an immediate threat that requires prompt attention.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-8334**
*   **Affected Software:** **Campcodes Online Recruitment Management System**
*   **Affected Version:** **1.0**
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input within the system. Specifically, the `ID` argument in the `delete_recruitment_status` action within the `/admin/ajax.php` file is vulnerable to SQL Injection. This means that instead of a legitimate ID, an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the parameter. The application then executes this code directly against its database.
*   **Affected Path/Example:** An attacker can exploit this remotely by manipulating requests targeting the following endpoint:
    `/admin/ajax.php?action=delete_recruitment_status`

    An example of a malicious payload might involve injecting SQL commands through the `ID` parameter, for instance:
    `GET /admin/ajax.php?action=delete_recruitment_status&ID=1%20OR%201=1--`
    (Note: `%20` is the URL-encoded space, and `--` is a common SQL comment marker used to bypass trailing legitimate code.)

### Risk Description

If exploited, this SQL Injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This could lead to:

*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could extract sensitive information, including applicant names, contact details, resumes, and potentially other confidential organizational data.
*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Records within the database could be modified or deleted, disrupting recruitment processes and corrupting critical data.
*   **System Compromise:** In some cases, successful SQL Injection can lead to remote code execution on the server, giving the attacker full control over the underlying system.
*   **Denial of Service:** Deleting critical data or records could render the recruitment system unusable.

The CVSS 4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is 6.9 (Medium), but given the nature of SQL Injection and the sensitive data handled by recruitment systems, its impact is indeed critical.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or business currently utilizing **Campcodes Online Recruitment Management System version 1.0** for their online recruitment processes is directly at risk. This includes HR departments, hiring managers, and IT teams responsible for maintaining these systems.

### Recommendations

**For Developers (if you are the software vendor or maintaining a fork):**

*   **Input Validation:** Implement stringent input validation for all user-supplied data, especially parameters used in database queries.
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code, preventing SQL Injection attacks.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account used by the application has only the minimum necessary privileges.

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The most critical recommendation is to apply any official patches or updates released by the vendor.
*   **Cease Use (if no patch):** If no patch for version 1.0 is available, strongly consider immediately discontinuing its use and migrating to a secure, supported alternative.
*   **Restrict Access:** As a temporary mitigation, consider implementing network access controls (e.g., firewall rules) to restrict access to the `/admin/` directory to trusted IP addresses only. This is not a fix, but a way to reduce exposure.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Increase logging and monitoring for suspicious activity related to the `/admin/ajax.php` endpoint.
