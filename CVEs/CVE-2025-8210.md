**Improper Component Export Vulnerability in Yeelight Android App**

Improperly configured Android application components pose a significant security risk. Such vulnerabilities can enable other applications on the same device to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to local privilege escalation or data compromise without direct user interaction for the attack.

**Vulnerability Details**

A vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8210**, has been discovered in the **Yeelink Yeelight App** on Android, affecting versions up to **3.5.4**.

The core of the issue lies in an **improper export of Android application components**. Specifically, an unspecified function within the **`AndroidManifest.xml`** file, associated with the **`com.yeelight.cherry`** component, is configured in a problematic manner. This misconfiguration allows other applications installed on the same Android device to interact with or invoke this component without the necessary permissions or authorization.

**Exploitation and Risks**

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires **local access** to the device (Attack Vector: Local, **AV:L**). The attack complexity is low (**AC:L**), and no user interaction is required (**UI:N**). Proof-of-concept exploit code has been publicly disclosed and may be used.

The CVSS v4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is **4.8 (Medium)**. While the immediate impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is rated as low (**VC:L/VI:L/VA:L**), the improper export can still lead to **unauthorized access to app-specific data**, **limited data modification**, or **unexpected triggering of app functionalities** by a malicious application residing on the same device.

The vendor was contacted regarding this disclosure but has not provided any response.

**Recommendations**

*   **For Users:** Immediately check for and install any available updates for the Yeelight App beyond version 3.5.4. If no official patch is available, exercise caution regarding the installation of other untrusted applications on the same device where the Yeelight App is installed.
*   **For Developers (Yeelink):** Conduct a thorough security review of the **`AndroidManifest.xml`** file to identify all exported components (activities, services, broadcast receivers, content providers). Ensure that only components explicitly designed for inter-app communication are exported, and strictly enforce appropriate permissions for their access. Components not intended for external access should explicitly set **`android:exported="false"`**.
