## Critical Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability Discovered in Vivaldi United Group iCONTROL+ Server

A newly identified security flaw in **Vivaldi United Group iCONTROL+ Server** could pose a significant risk to organizations using this system. This **cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, or system integrity issues, potentially impacting operations and customer trust. Understanding this flaw is crucial for mitigating potential business disruption and financial loss.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-52358**
*   **Affected Software:** **Vivaldi United Group iCONTROL+ Server**
*   **Affected Versions:** **Firmware version 4.7.8.0.eden Logic version 5.32 and below**

This vulnerability is a **cross-site scripting (XSS)** flaw. It arises because the server does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page. Specifically, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into parameters such as `error` or `edit-menu-item`. When an unsuspecting user views a page containing this injected code, it executes within their web browser, making it appear as if the malicious script originated from the legitimate server.

**Example Payloads/Paths:**
Attackers could craft URLs similar to these to inject malicious scripts:
`https://[server_ip]/[path]?error=<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
`https://[server_ip]/[path]?edit-menu-item=<script>alert('XSS');</script>`

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of this **XSS** vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

*   **Steal sensitive information:** Such as session cookies, enabling them to hijack user sessions and impersonate legitimate users, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system with the victim's privileges.
*   **Deface websites:** Alter the content of affected pages, impacting brand reputation.
*   **Redirect users:** Force victims to malicious websites designed for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Install malware:** Initiate downloads or execute malicious code on the victim's machine, if combined with other vulnerabilities or social engineering tactics.
*   **Compromise user accounts:** Gain unauthorized access to the system with the privileges of the victim user.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual operating **Vivaldi United Group iCONTROL+ Server** instances with **Firmware version 4.7.8.0.eden Logic version 5.32 and below** is at risk. This includes potentially critical infrastructure or building management systems if iCONTROL+ is used in such contexts.

### Recommendations

To mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability, we urge all affected parties to take immediate action:

**For Developers & System Administrators (Vivaldi United Group):**

*   **Prioritize Patch Development:** Develop and release a security patch that addresses improper input validation and output encoding in all vulnerable parameters, especially `error` and `edit-menu-item`.
*   **Implement Strict Input Validation:** Ensure all user-supplied input is rigorously validated against expected formats and types.
*   **Apply Output Encoding:** Encode all data before it is rendered in the browser to prevent malicious scripts from executing.

**For Organizations Using iCONTROL+ Server:**

*   **Monitor for Official Patches:** Regularly check for security advisories and official patches from Vivaldi United Group. Apply updates as soon as they are available.
*   **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Configure a WAF to detect and block malicious XSS payloads attempting to reach your server. This can offer a temporary layer of protection.
*   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the iCONTROL+ server interface to only trusted personnel and networks, preferably via VPN or internal networks.
*   **Educate Users:** Inform users about phishing and social engineering risks, as XSS attacks can often be part of broader campaigns.
