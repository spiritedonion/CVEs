## Urgent: Critical Information Disclosure Vulnerability Discovered in HP LaserJet Pro Printers

Organizations relying on HP LaserJet Pro printers are currently exposed to a significant risk of sensitive information disclosure. This newly identified vulnerability could allow unauthorized parties to access confidential data, potentially leading to privacy breaches, compliance issues, and reputational damage. It is crucial for all affected organizations to understand this risk and take immediate steps to mitigate it.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical information disclosure vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-43018**, has been discovered in certain **HP LaserJet Pro** printer models.

The issue stems from the fact that a non-authenticated user can query a deviceâ€™s local address book. This means an attacker, without needing any credentials or prior access, can directly request and retrieve entries from the printer's internal contact list.

While specific affected version numbers are not detailed in the initial alert, it is critical that all users of **HP LaserJet Pro printers** consult the official advisory for definitive information on impacted models and firmware versions.

The vulnerability's severity is rated as **MEDIUM** with a CVSS Base Score of **6.9**. The full CVSS 4.0 vector is: `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:N/MSC:X/MSI:N/MSA:N/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X`.

### Risk Description

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to an organization's internal contact information stored within the printer's address book. This data might include employee names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive corporate contacts. Such information could then be used for targeted phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, or even sold on the dark web, leading to further security incidents or financial losses. The unauthorized access is possible directly over the network without any form of authentication.

### Who is at Risk?

Any organization or individual utilizing **HP LaserJet Pro printers** that are connected to a network, especially those accessible from external networks or unsegmented internal networks, are at risk. This includes corporate offices, small businesses, and potentially home offices where these printers are used and store contact information.

### Recommendations

**For IT Teams and System Administrators:**

1.  **Monitor for Firmware Updates:** HP is expected to release firmware updates to address this vulnerability. Regularly check the official HP support website for patches specifically for your **HP LaserJet Pro** models. Implement these updates as soon as they become available.
2.  **Network Segmentation:** Isolate printers on a separate network segment (VLAN) or subnet. Restrict network access to these devices only to necessary internal systems or authorized personnel using firewall rules.
3.  **Disable Unused Services:** Review printer configurations and disable any network services or protocols that are not strictly necessary for operation.
4.  **Review Printer Address Book Content:** Assess what information is currently stored in your printer's address books. Minimize the storage of highly sensitive or confidential data where possible.
5.  **Perimeter Security:** Ensure your network perimeter controls (firewalls, intrusion prevention systems) are up to date and configured to prevent unauthorized external access to internal network devices.
