## Critical XSS Vulnerability Discovered in Intelbras RX1500 and RX3000 Routers

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in specific versions of **Intelbras RX1500** and **RX3000** routers. This Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability poses a significant risk, potentially allowing attackers to execute malicious code within a user's browser session. For businesses and individuals, this could lead to sensitive data theft, unauthorized access to systems, or broader network compromise.

### Vulnerability Details

This newly identified flaw, tracked as **CVE-2025-26064**, impacts the following Intelbras router models and firmware versions:

*   **Intelbras RX1500** firmware version **v2.2.9**
*   **Intelbras RX3000** firmware version **v1.0.11**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and output encoding within the device management interface. Specifically, it allows an attacker to inject malicious web scripts or HTML code into the "name" field of a connected device. When an authorized user (such as an administrator) views the list of connected devices on the router's web interface, their browser executes this injected code.

An example of a malicious payload that could be injected into a device name might look like this:

```html
<script>alert('Router Compromised!');</script>
```

More sophisticated attacks could involve scripts designed to steal session cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

### Risk Description

Exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could enable an attacker to:

*   **Steal sensitive information:** This includes administrator session cookies, which could grant the attacker full control over the router's configuration.
*   **Deface the web interface:** Malicious content or messages could be displayed to anyone accessing the router's management page.
*   **Redirect users:** Users attempting to access the router's interface could be redirected to malicious phishing sites.
*   **Execute unauthorized actions:** Depending on the administrator's privileges, the attacker could change router settings, open ports, or even deploy further malware within the network.

This direct access to the router's administrative functions presents a severe risk to data integrity, network security, and operational continuity.

### Who is at Risk

Organizations and individuals utilizing **Intelbras RX1500 v2.2.9** or **RX3000 v1.0.11** routers are directly at risk. This includes small and medium-sized businesses, home offices, and any network where these specific devices are deployed in their vulnerable versions.

### Recommendations

**For Intelbras (Vendor):**

*   Prioritize the development and release of a security patch that addresses this vulnerability.
*   Implement robust input validation for all user-supplied data, especially for fields like device names and other configuration parameters.
*   Ensure proper output encoding is applied to all data displayed in the web interface to prevent script execution.

**For Router Owners and IT Administrators:**

*   **Urgent Firmware Update:** Immediately check the official Intelbras support website for updated firmware versions for your **RX1500** or **RX3000** router. Apply any available security patches as soon as possible.
*   **Review Connected Devices:** Periodically review the list of connected devices on your router and ensure their names do not contain suspicious characters or code.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Where possible, segment your network to isolate critical systems from less secure or potentially compromised devices.
*   **Monitor Network Traffic:** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual outbound connections or suspicious activity originating from the router or internal network.
*   **Strong Authentication:** Always use strong, unique passwords for router administration interfaces.
*   **Limit Admin Access:** Restrict access to the router's administration interface to trusted internal networks only, if feasible.
