## Security Alert: Critical CSRF Vulnerability (CVE-2025-54528) in JetBrains TeamCity

A new critical security vulnerability has been identified in JetBrains TeamCity, a widely used continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) server. This vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-54528**, could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions within your TeamCity environment, posing a significant risk to your development pipelines and data integrity.

For business leaders, this means a potential disruption to critical development workflows, compromise of sensitive build data, or unauthorized changes that could impact software delivery and security posture. It's crucial to address this promptly to maintain operational continuity and data security.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-54528**
*   **Affected Software:** JetBrains **TeamCity**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions **before 2025.07**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw within the **GitHub App connection flow**. In simple terms, this means an attacker could craft a malicious webpage or link that, if visited by an authenticated TeamCity user, would force their browser to perform an unwanted action on the TeamCity server without their knowledge or consent. This leverages the user's active session to execute commands.
*   **Example of Attack Vector:** While specific payloads vary, a typical CSRF attack involves tricking an authenticated user into clicking a link or visiting a compromised website that contains hidden requests to the vulnerable TeamCity instance. For example, a malicious link could look like: `https://your-teamcity.com/githubApp/connect?action=malicious_config_change`.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this CSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on your TeamCity instance. Depending on the privileges of the targeted user, this could include:

*   Modifying **GitHub App** connection settings.
*   Making unauthorized changes to project configurations.
*   Potentially disrupting or manipulating build pipelines.
*   Gaining access to sensitive information or resources connected through the GitHub App integration.

The unauthorized access and manipulation could lead to data theft, system compromise, or significant disruption to your CI/CD operations.

### Who is at Risk?

Organizations and development teams that use **JetBrains TeamCity** are at risk, particularly those that have integrated or plan to integrate with **GitHub Apps**. Any TeamCity instance running an affected version is vulnerable if an authenticated user can be tricked into triggering the malicious request.

### Recommendations

**For TeamCity Administrators and IT Teams:**

1.  **Immediate Update:** The most critical step is to upgrade your **JetBrains TeamCity** instance to version **2025.07** or newer without delay. This version contains the necessary security patch to address this vulnerability.
2.  **Review Integrations:** After updating, thoroughly review your **GitHub App** connections and other external integrations within TeamCity to ensure no unauthorized changes occurred.
3.  **User Awareness:** Educate your users about the risks of phishing, suspicious links, and unexpected pop-ups. CSRF attacks often rely on social engineering to trick users.

**For Developers (JetBrains):**
JetBrains has addressed this vulnerability in version 2025.07. Continued rigorous security testing and adherence to secure coding practices, especially concerning authenticated session management and input validation, are crucial for preventing similar issues.
