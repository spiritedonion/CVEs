## SQL Injection Vulnerability in Campcodes Courier Management System

Vulnerabilities that allow **SQL Injection** pose significant risks to web applications, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data compromise, and system manipulation. Addressing such flaws is critical to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical **SQL Injection** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8186**, has been discovered in **Campcodes Courier Management System version 1.0**.

The flaw resides within the `/edit_branch.php` file. It specifically affects the **ID** argument, which is susceptible to malicious manipulation. Attackers can remotely inject arbitrary SQL queries due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

*   **Affected Software:** Campcodes Courier Management System
*   **Affected Version:** 1.0
*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-8186`
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected File:** `/edit_branch.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `ID`
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote
*   **Exploit Status:** The exploit has been publicly disclosed and may be actively used.

The CVSS v4.0 vector for this vulnerability is `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X`, yielding a **Base Score of 5.3 (Medium)**.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials, customer data, and internal operational details.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The ability to alter or delete existing records, compromising data integrity.
*   **Denial of Service:** Disrupting application functionality by corrupting or deleting critical database tables.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain database configurations, SQL injection can be escalated to achieve remote code execution on the underlying server, giving attackers full control.

### Recommendations

For developers and site owners using **Campcodes Courier Management System 1.0**, immediate action is advised:

*   **Patch or Upgrade:** If an official patch or a newer, fixed version of the software becomes available, apply it immediately.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement **strict input validation** and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially parameters passed through URL arguments or form fields. Ensure that the `ID` parameter in `/edit_branch.php` is strictly validated to only accept expected data types (e.g., integers).
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Utilize **prepared statements** or **parameterized queries** for all database interactions. This prevents SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-supplied input.
*   **Least Privilege:** Configure database users with the **principle of least privilege**, granting only the minimum necessary permissions required for their operations.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to provide an additional layer of defense by filtering malicious requests before they reach the application.
