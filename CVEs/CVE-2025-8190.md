## Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability in Campcodes Courier Management System

SQL Injection vulnerabilities represent a significant risk to web applications, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete system compromise. This alert details a recently disclosed critical SQL Injection flaw affecting Campcodes Courier Management System, highlighting the urgent need for mitigation.

### Vulnerability Details

A **critical** SQL Injection vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8190**, has been discovered in **Campcodes Courier Management System version 1.0**. The vulnerability affects the application's `/print_pdets.php` file.

The vulnerability's CVSSv4 Base Score is 5.3, classifying it as Medium severity, though the initial classification described it as critical.

### Technical Cause

The vulnerability stems from improper input validation or sanitization of the `ids` argument within the `/print_pdets.php` file. An attacker can manipulate this argument to inject arbitrary SQL queries directly into the application's database calls. This allows for unauthorized database operations to be performed.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this SQL Injection flaw can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, customer data, or operational details.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of existing data, potentially impacting system integrity or disrupting operations.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain database configurations, it might be possible to escalate the attack to achieve remote code execution on the underlying server, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially corrupt the database, leading to service disruption.

The vulnerability is **remotely exploitable**, and an exploit has been publicly disclosed, increasing the urgency for mitigation.

### Recommendations

Developers and system administrators of Campcodes Courier Management System are strongly advised to take immediate action:

*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all user-supplied data, especially parameters used in database queries.
*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code, effectively preventing SQL injection.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions, limiting potential damage from a successful SQL injection.
*   **Software Updates:** Monitor the official Campcodes Courier Management System channels for patches or updated versions that address this vulnerability.
