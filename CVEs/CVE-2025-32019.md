### Harbor Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

Securing container registries like Harbor is paramount, as they serve as foundational components in modern software supply chains. A vulnerability within such a critical system can have far-reaching implications, potentially compromising the integrity and security of deployed applications. This report details a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability identified in Harbor.

#### Vulnerability Details

A **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-32019**, exists in the Harbor container registry. The flaw stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Affected Software and Versions:**
*   **Harbor** versions `2.11.2` and below
*   **Harbor** version `2.12.0-rc1`
*   **Harbor** version `2.13.0-rc1`

**Technical Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the **markdown field** on the **info tab page**. An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into this field. When another user views this page, the injected script is executed within their browser session. This indicates a lack of adequate input validation or output encoding for content rendered from the markdown field.

**Potential Risks:**
A successful **XSS** attack can lead to various severe consequences, including:
*   **Session hijacking**: An attacker could steal a user's session cookies or authentication tokens, gaining unauthorized access to their Harbor account.
*   **Data exposure**: Sensitive information displayed to the victim's browser could be exfiltrated.
*   **Defacement**: The user interface of the Harbor instance could be altered to display misleading or malicious content.
*   **Redirection**: Users could be redirected to malicious websites.
*   **Arbitrary actions**: Attackers could perform actions on behalf of the victim within the Harbor application, potentially leading to the compromise of repositories, projects, or user accounts.

#### Recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is critical to upgrade Harbor installations immediately.

**Recommended Versions:**
*   Upgrade to **Harbor** version `2.11.3`
*   Upgrade to **Harbor** version `2.12.3`
