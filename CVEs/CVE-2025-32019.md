## Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in Harbor Registry

Container registries like Harbor are critical components in modern software supply chains, responsible for storing and managing container images. A vulnerability in such a system can have significant security implications, potentially compromising not only the registry itself but also the integrity of deployed applications. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous as they allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in a user's browser, leading to various forms of compromise.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-32019**, has been discovered in Harbor. This flaw affects multiple versions of the open-source trusted cloud-native registry project.

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the **markdown field** located on the **info tab page**. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into this field. When a legitimate user views the affected page, the injected script is executed within their browser, operating under the security context of the Harbor application.

### Affected Versions

The vulnerability is present in the following Harbor versions:

*   Harbor `2.11.2` and below
*   Harbor `2.12.0-rc1`
*   Harbor `2.13.0-rc1`

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the victim's Harbor session without needing credentials.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information visible to the compromised user could be exfiltrated.
*   **Defacement:** Malicious content could be displayed to other users, impacting trust and operational integrity.
*   **Further Exploitation:** XSS can serve as a stepping stone for more advanced attacks, such as tricking users into performing actions (CSRF) or potentially gaining control over the underlying server if combined with other vulnerabilities.

### Recommendations

Harbor users and administrators are strongly advised to upgrade their installations immediately to a patched version to mitigate this critical vulnerability.

The vulnerability has been fixed in the following versions:

*   Harbor `2.11.3`
*   Harbor `2.12.3`

Ensure your Harbor deployment is updated to one of these fixed versions or a later secure release.
