## Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in Harbor

Harbor is a widely adopted open-source cloud-native registry project, essential for storing, signing, and scanning container images. Vulnerabilities within such critical infrastructure components can directly impact the security and integrity of software supply chains, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data compromise, or disruption of development and deployment pipelines.

### Vulnerability Details

A **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability has been identified in Harbor. This flaw allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-32019`
*   **Affected Software:** Harbor
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   All versions **2.11.2 and below**
    *   Release candidate **2.12.0-rc1**
    *   Release candidate **2.13.0-rc1**

### Technical Cause

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the **markdown field** located on the info tab page of the Harbor interface. An attacker can embed malicious script code within this field. When a legitimate user views this specially crafted page, their web browser executes the injected script, operating within the context of the user's session.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal user session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the victim's Harbor account with their privileges.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive information displayed to the victim user could be stolen and sent to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Account Compromise:** Malicious actions could be performed on behalf of the victim user within the Harbor application.
*   **Defacement or Malicious Redirection:** The attacker could alter the content of the web page or redirect the victim to a malicious website.

### Recommendations

It is **critically important** for all users and administrators of Harbor instances to upgrade their deployments immediately to mitigate this security risk.

*   Upgrade to **Harbor version 2.11.3**
*   Upgrade to **Harbor version 2.12.3**

These versions contain the necessary fixes to address the XSS vulnerability.
