This vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-8258**, poses a risk to user data and device integrity, as it could allow unauthorized access to application components and potentially sensitive information on affected devices. For businesses, this translates to potential user data compromise and reputational damage if their employees or customers use the vulnerable app.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-8258**
*   **Affected Software:** **Cool Mo Maigcal Number App**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to **1.0.3** on Android.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an "improper export" of Android application components within the app's configuration. Specifically, a component related to `com.sdmagic.number` is configured in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in a way that allows other applications on the same device to access it when they shouldn't. This misconfiguration can be exploited by a malicious app installed on the user's device.
*   **Severity:** **MEDIUM** (CVSS v4.0 Base Score: 4.8)
*   **Published:** 2025-07-28
*   **Affected Component:** `AndroidManifest.xml` of the `com.sdmagic.number` component.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker, through a co-located malicious application on the same Android device, to:

*   **Access Restricted Data:** Potentially retrieve or modify data managed by the **Cool Mo Maigcal Number App**.
*   **Perform Unauthorized Actions:** Interact with app functionalities that are intended to be private, leading to unintended behavior or data manipulation.
*   **Compromise Device Privacy:** While requiring local access, a successful exploit could lead to a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected app's data on the device.

It's important to note that a public proof-of-concept exploit for this vulnerability has been disclosed, increasing the immediate risk for users of the affected app.
