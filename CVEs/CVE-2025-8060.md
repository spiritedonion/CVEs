### Critical Vulnerability Discovered in Tenda AC23 Router

The security of network infrastructure devices, such as routers, is paramount. A vulnerability in a router can expose an entire network to compromise, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of services. It is critical for network administrators and users to stay informed about and address such vulnerabilities promptly.

A new critical vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8060**, has been discovered in the **Tenda AC23** wireless router, specifically version `16.03.07.52`. This vulnerability is classified as critical with a CVSS 4.0 Base Score of 7.4 (High).

The vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** located within the `httpd` component of the router's firmware. Specifically, the `sub_46C940` function, which is part of the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` endpoint, is susceptible. An attacker can trigger this overflow by providing an excessively long or malformed value for the `deviceList` argument.

The technical cause is the improper handling of input data, where the system attempts to write more data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack than it can hold. This overwrites adjacent memory, which can corrupt data or execution flow.

This vulnerability is **remotely exploitable** with low privileges (e.g., authenticated access to the router's web interface), and requires no user interaction. A proof-of-concept exploit for this vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.

**Potential Risks:**
Exploitation of this stack-based buffer overflow can lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the router with the privileges of the `httpd` process, potentially gaining full control over the device. This could enable:
*   Complete compromise of the router.
*   Interception or redirection of network traffic.
*   Creation of backdoors for persistent access.
*   Launching further attacks against internal networks.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the device.

**Recommendations for Developers and Site Owners:**
*   **Firmware Update:** Immediately check for and apply any available firmware updates from Tenda that address **CVE-2025-8060**. This is the most effective mitigation.
*   **Access Restriction:** If an update is not immediately available, restrict access to the router's administration interface (web UI) to trusted IP addresses or internal networks only. Avoid exposing the administrative interface to the public internet.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the router on the network if immediate patching is not feasible, limiting its exposure and the potential blast radius of an exploit.
*   **Network Monitoring:** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns or unauthorized access attempts targeting your router.
