### Critical Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Tenda AC23 Routers

A critical vulnerability has been identified in Tenda AC23 routers, posing significant security risks due to its remote exploitability and public disclosure. This flaw could allow attackers to compromise affected devices, leading to unauthorized access and control.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-8060`
*   **Affected Product and Version:** **Tenda AC23** firmware version **16.03.07.52**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** located in the `sub_46C940` function. This function resides within the **httpd** component, specifically handled by the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` endpoint. The overflow occurs when an attacker manipulates the `deviceList` argument with excessively long or malformed input.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited **remotely**, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the device or local network segment.
*   **Exploit Status:** An exploit for this vulnerability has been **publicly disclosed**, increasing the urgency for mitigation.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v4.0 base score of **7.4 (High)**, with a vector of `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H`. This indicates high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this stack-based buffer overflow could lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the router, gaining full control over the device. This could allow for device manipulation, surveillance, or use of the router as a pivot point for further attacks on the internal network.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive configuration data or user credentials stored on the device could be compromised.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious input could cause the device to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting network connectivity.

### Recommendations for Developers and Site Owners

*   **Firmware Update:** Urgently check for and apply any official firmware updates released by Tenda that address `CVE-2025-8060`. This is the most effective way to remediate the vulnerability.
*   **Network Segmentation:** If immediate updates are not possible, isolate the router's administrative interface from untrusted networks.
*   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the router's management interface to trusted devices and personnel only, preferably from a secure internal network.
*   **Monitor for Anomalies:** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns or unexpected device behavior that might indicate an attempted or successful exploit.
