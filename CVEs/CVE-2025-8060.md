Critical Vulnerability in Tenda AC23 Router

Network devices like routers are foundational components of any network, and vulnerabilities within them can expose the entire infrastructure to significant risks. Exploiting such flaws can lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, and disruption of services, making it crucial to address them promptly.

### Vulnerability Details

A **critical severity vulnerability** has been identified in the Tenda AC23 router, specifically affecting version `16.03.07.52`. This flaw is tracked as **CVE-2025-8060**.

The vulnerability lies within the `httpd` component, specifically in the `sub_46C940` function of the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` file. It is classified as a **stack-based buffer overflow**.

**Affected Product and Version:**

*   **Product:** Tenda AC23 Router
*   **Version:** `16.03.07.52`

**Technical Cause:**

The vulnerability is triggered by the manipulation of the `deviceList` argument. A malicious actor can provide an overly long or specially crafted value for this argument when interacting with the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` endpoint. This input exceeds the allocated buffer size on the stack, leading to a **stack-based buffer overflow**.

The attack can be launched remotely, meaning an attacker does not require physical access to the device or local network presence in many scenarios. An exploit for this vulnerability has been publicly disclosed, increasing the immediate risk.

The CVSS 4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is **7.4 (High)**, with significant impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H).

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this **stack-based buffer overflow** can lead to several severe consequences, including:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the router with the privileges of the affected process. This could allow for complete control over the device.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious input could crash the `httpd` service, rendering the router unmanageable or disrupting network connectivity for connected users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some buffer overflow scenarios, sensitive memory contents could be exposed.

### Recommendations

For developers and site owners managing Tenda AC23 routers:

1.  **Apply Firmware Updates:** Immediately check for and apply any official firmware updates released by Tenda that address **CVE-2025-8060**.
2.  **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the router on a segment of the network where it cannot be directly accessed from untrusted networks (e.g., the internet) if no patch is available.
3.  **Restrict Access:** Limit administrative access to the router's web interface to trusted users and only from secure, internal networks. Disable remote management if not strictly necessary.
4.  **Monitor Network Traffic:** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns or connection attempts targeting the router's management interfaces.
