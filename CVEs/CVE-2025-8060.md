## Critical Stack Buffer Overflow in Tenda AC23 Routers

Network infrastructure devices like routers are common targets for attackers due to their always-on nature and direct access to internal networks. A critical vulnerability in such devices can grant an attacker a foothold into an organization's or home network, leading to severe compromise.

### Vulnerability Details

A **critical stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability**, identified as **CVE-2025-8060**, has been discovered in the **Tenda AC23** router firmware version **16.03.07.52**.

This vulnerability resides within the `httpd` component, specifically in the `sub_46C940` function of the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` file. The technical cause is insufficient bounds checking when processing the `deviceList` argument. An attacker can manipulate this argument to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, leading to the overflow.

The vulnerability is **remotely exploitable**, meaning an attacker can trigger it over the network without requiring physical access. Furthermore, an exploit for this vulnerability has already been **publicly disclosed**. The CVSS 4.0 base score for this vulnerability is 7.4 (High), reflecting its severity.

### Potential Risks

A successful exploitation of this **stack-based buffer overflow** can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most significant risk, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected router with the privileges of the vulnerable process (often root), gaining complete control over the device.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause the router's `httpd` service to crash, leading to a disruption of network services.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, buffer overflows can be exploited to leak sensitive information from the device's memory.

Given the router's position at the network edge, **RCE** can facilitate further attacks on the internal network, data exfiltration, or the establishment of persistent backdoors.

### Recommendations

*   **For Site Owners/Administrators:**
    *   Immediately verify the firmware version of your **Tenda AC23** router. If it is **16.03.07.52**, you are vulnerable.
    *   Monitor Tenda's official support channels for an official firmware update addressing **CVE-2025-8060**. Apply any patches as soon as they become available.
    *   If an immediate patch is not available, consider network segmentation to isolate the router or place it behind a more robust firewall as a temporary mitigation.
    *   As a last resort, consider replacing the device if it's critical to your network infrastructure and no patch is forthcoming.
*   **For Developers:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and boundary checks for all user-supplied data, especially in functions that handle network requests or process configuration parameters like `deviceList`.
    *   Adopt memory-safe programming practices to prevent buffer overflows and other memory corruption issues.
    *   Utilize compiler-level security features such as stack canaries to detect and prevent stack buffer overflows.
    *   Conduct thorough security testing, including fuzzing, static application security testing (SAST), and dynamic application security testing (DAST), to identify similar vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
