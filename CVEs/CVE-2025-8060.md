### Tenda AC23 Router Stack-Based Buffer Overflow (CVE-2025-8060)

Vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices like routers are critically important due to their position as gateways to internal networks. A compromise can grant attackers deep access, making timely identification and remediation essential to protect an organization's entire network.

#### Vulnerability Details

A critical **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8060**, has been discovered in the **Tenda AC23 router** firmware version **16.03.07.52**.

This flaw resides within the **httpd** component, specifically in the function `sub_46C940` of the file `/goform/setMacFilterCfg`. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the **`deviceList`** argument supplied to this function.

The attack can be launched **remotely**, making it highly dangerous. An exploit for this vulnerability has been **publicly disclosed**, increasing the immediate risk of exploitation.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v4.0 score is **7.4 HIGH**, with a vector of `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P`. This indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable over the network with low attack complexity, requires no user interaction, and has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The "E:P" signifies that a proof-of-concept exploit is available.

#### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this stack-based buffer overflow could lead to **remote code execution (RCE)**. An attacker could leverage this to gain full control over the affected Tenda AC23 router.

This level of control could enable various malicious activities, including:
*   **Network compromise:** Gaining unauthorized access to devices connected to the router.
*   **Data exposure:** Intercepting or redirecting network traffic to access sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing the device to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Persistent access:** Installing backdoors or malicious firmware for long-term control.

#### Recommendations

*   **Firmware Update:** Owners of Tenda AC23 routers running firmware version **16.03.07.52** should immediately check for and apply the latest available firmware update from Tenda's official support channels.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate the router and other critical devices from less trusted segments of the network.
*   **Access Control:** Restrict administrative access to the router's web interface and management ports (e.g., SSH, Telnet) to only trusted internal IP addresses. Disable remote management if not strictly necessary.
*   **Monitoring:** Deploy network monitoring solutions to detect unusual traffic patterns or unauthorized access attempts to router interfaces.
