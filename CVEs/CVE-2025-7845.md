## Urgent Security Alert: Critical Stored XSS Vulnerability in Stratum – Elementor Widgets Plugin

A new critical security vulnerability has been identified in the **Stratum – Elementor Widgets** plugin for WordPress. This flaw, tracked as **CVE-2025-7845**, poses a significant risk to websites using the affected versions, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and reputational damage. For businesses, this translates directly into financial risk, loss of customer trust, and potential compliance issues.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-7845**
*   **Affected Software:** **Stratum – Elementor Widgets** plugin for WordPress
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **1.6.0**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw, specifically found within the plugin's **Advanced Google Maps** and **Image Hotspot** widgets. It arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. This means the plugin does not adequately clean or neutralize malicious code embedded into user inputs before storing and displaying them.
*   **How it Works:** An authenticated attacker, with at least `contributor-level` access (or higher roles like author, editor, administrator), can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages through these vulnerable widgets. For example, they might input malicious HTML or JavaScript code into a widget's settings, which could look like:
    ```html
    <script>alert('Malicious code executed!');</script>
    ```
    Since the plugin doesn't properly sanitize this input, the script is stored in the website's database. When a legitimate user or administrator then visits the page containing the injected widget, their browser executes this malicious code.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts in the browsers of users viewing an affected page. The consequences of such an exploit can be severe:

*   **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information, including user credentials, session cookies, and personal data.
*   **Website Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of your website without authorization.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Taking control of legitimate user sessions, potentially leading to unauthorized administrative access.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting visitors to malicious websites or forcing the download of malware.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due due to compromised website integrity.

### Who is at Risk

Any WordPress website currently using the **Stratum – Elementor Widgets** plugin is at risk if it is running version **1.6.0** or an older version. Websites that allow contributor-level users or higher to create or modify content using these specific widgets are particularly vulnerable.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The most critical step is to update the **Stratum – Elementor Widgets** plugin to the latest available version as soon as possible. Check your WordPress dashboard for available updates.
*   **Regular Updates:** Ensure all your WordPress plugins, themes, and the core WordPress installation are always kept up-to-date to protect against known vulnerabilities.
*   **Review User Permissions:** Periodically review user roles and permissions on your website, following the principle of least privilege.

**For Developers:**

*   **Input Sanitization:** Ensure all user-supplied input is rigorously sanitized before it is processed or stored in the database. Use WordPress's built-in sanitization functions like `sanitize_text_field()`, `wp_kses()`, etc.
*   **Output Escaping:** Always escape all data before it is outputted to the browser. Use appropriate escaping functions like `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`, or `wp_json_encode()` as needed to prevent malicious code from executing.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing for your plugins and themes.
