## Immediate Action Required: Critical Vulnerability Discovered in Copyparty File Server

A new critical vulnerability has been identified in **Copyparty**, a popular portable file server. This flaw could allow an attacker to disrupt your operations by making your file server completely inaccessible. For organizations relying on **Copyparty** for file sharing, this vulnerability poses a significant risk of service disruption, impacting productivity and potentially causing data access issues.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-54796**
*   **Affected Software:** **Copyparty**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to **1.18.9**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how **Copyparty** handles the "filter" parameter on its "Recent Uploads" page. By default, this feature allows users to apply regular expressions (RegExes) to filter results. However, versions prior to **1.18.9** do not adequately validate these inputs. An attacker can craft a highly complex or computationally intensive RegEx and submit it via this parameter. This malicious input causes the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a "deadlock" state where the server becomes unresponsive and inaccessible.

### Risk Description

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This means they can deliberately crash or freeze your **Copyparty** server, making it unavailable to legitimate users. Such an incident would prevent employees or external partners from uploading, downloading, or accessing critical files, leading to severe operational downtime and potential financial losses for businesses heavily reliant on the server.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual using **Copyparty** as a file sharing or hosting solution is at risk, especially if the default "Recent Uploads" feature is enabled. This applies to various setups, from internal file shares to public-facing download repositories powered by **Copyparty**.

### Recommendations

**For Copyparty Users and Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** The most crucial step is to **update your Copyparty installation to version 1.18.9 or later immediately**. This version contains the necessary patch to address the vulnerability.
*   **Verify Update:** After updating, confirm that your **Copyparty** instance is running version **1.18.9** or higher to ensure the patch has been successfully applied.

**For Developers (of Copyparty):**

*   The issue has been addressed in version **1.18.9** by implementing robust validation of regular expression inputs to prevent resource exhaustion. Continue to ensure all user-supplied inputs, especially those processed by computationally intensive functions, are properly validated and sanitized.
