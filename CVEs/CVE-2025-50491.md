**New Critical Security Vulnerability Discovered in PHPGurukul Bank Locker Management System v1**

A critical security flaw has been identified in **PHPGurukul Bank Locker Management System v1**. This vulnerability, if exploited, could allow unauthorized individuals to gain access to sensitive banking operations and confidential customer data. For organizations relying on this system, this poses a significant risk of data breaches, financial fraud, and severe reputational damage.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-50491**
*   **Affected Software:** **PHPGurukul Bank Locker Management System**
*   **Affected Version:** **v1**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from **improper session invalidation** within the `/banker/change-password.php` component. In simple terms, when a user (such as a bank employee) changes their password, the system fails to properly terminate their previous active session. This means if an attacker had previously managed to steal a user's session ID (a temporary key that keeps someone logged in), they could continue to use that old session to access the system, even after the legitimate user has updated their credentials.
*   **Vulnerable Component Path:** `/banker/change-password.php`

**Risk Description:**

This flaw enables a **session hijacking** attack. An attacker who successfully obtains a legitimate user's session ID could effectively impersonate that user. This grants them unauthorized access to the bank locker management system, allowing them to:

*   View sensitive customer information.
*   Perform unauthorized transactions or modifications.
*   Potentially manipulate system data, leading to financial losses or operational disruption.
*   Compromise the integrity and confidentiality of your banking operations.

**Who is at Risk:**

Organizations and institutions currently using **PHPGurukul Bank Locker Management System v1** are directly impacted. This includes any entity that has deployed this specific version of the software for managing bank lockers and related operations.

**Recommendations:**

**For Developers:**

*   **Implement Robust Session Management:** Ensure that all sessions are immediately and completely invalidated upon critical actions such as password changes, account logouts, or suspicious activity detection.
*   **Invalidate Sessions on Password Change:** Specifically, verify that the `/banker/change-password.php` component (and any similar authentication-related components) explicitly invalidates all prior sessions for the user after a successful password update.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Review the entire codebase for similar session management vulnerabilities and implement secure coding best practices to prevent future issues.

**For System Owners/Administrators:**

*   **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check for official patches or updates from PHPGurukul addressing this vulnerability. Apply any security updates immediately upon release.
*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** While not a direct fix for this vulnerability, strong, unique passwords reduce the overall risk of account compromise.
*   **Educate Users:** Inform staff about phishing risks and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.
*   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If available, enable MFA for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security, making session hijacking more difficult.
*   **Review Logs:** Regularly review system logs for unusual login patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
