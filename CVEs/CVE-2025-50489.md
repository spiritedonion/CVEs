## Critical Session Hijacking Vulnerability Affects PHPGurukul Student Result Management System

In today's digital landscape, the security of sensitive data, especially within educational systems, is paramount. We are issuing an urgent alert regarding a newly discovered critical vulnerability in the **PHPGurukul Student Result Management System** that could lead to unauthorized access and significant data breaches.

This vulnerability poses a serious risk to the integrity and confidentiality of student records and overall system security. Organizations using this software must take immediate action to mitigate potential threats.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID**: **CVE-2025-50489**
*   **Affected Software**: **PHPGurukul Student Result Management System**
*   **Affected Version**: **v2.0**

This vulnerability stems from **improper session invalidation** within the `/srms/change-password.php` component. In essence, when a user changes their password within the system, their existing session should be immediately terminated and invalidated across all devices. However, this flaw allows previously active sessions to remain valid even after a password change.

**Exploitation Path**:
An attacker who manages to obtain a user's session ID (e.g., through network sniffing, malware, or exposed cookies) could maintain access to that user's account even if the legitimate user subsequently changes their password. The vulnerable component is located at:
`/srms/change-password.php`

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to **hijack a legitimate user's session**, effectively **taking complete control of their account**. This means an attacker could:

*   **Access sensitive student data**
*   **Modify academic records and grades**
*   **Impersonate users**
*   **Gain broader unauthorized access** within the system

The potential for **data theft**, **data manipulation**, and severe **reputational damage** is high.

### Who is at Risk

Any educational institution, training center, or organization utilizing **PHPGurukul Student Result Management System v2.0** is immediately at risk. This includes systems managing student grades, personal information, attendance, and other sensitive academic records.

### Recommendations

**For Developers of PHPGurukul Student Result Management System:**

*   **Immediate Patching**: Release an urgent patch that ensures all active sessions are properly invalidated upon password changes, logouts, or other critical security events.
*   **Session Management Review**: Implement robust session management practices, including regenerating session IDs upon successful authentication and ensuring comprehensive invalidation mechanisms.
*   **Secure Coding Practices**: Conduct a thorough security audit of the entire codebase to identify and remediate similar improper invalidation issues.

**For Website Owners and IT Administrators:**

*   **Urgent Update**: As soon as a patch becomes available, update your **PHPGurukul Student Result Management System** to the latest secure version without delay.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity**: Regularly review system logs for unusual access patterns, multiple logins from different locations for the same account, or unauthorized data modifications.
*   **Enforce Security Best Practices**: Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available within the system or via an external proxy.
*   **Temporary Mitigation (if no patch available)**: While awaiting a patch, consider implementing strict session timeouts and educating users about the risks of public Wi-Fi and phishing attacks to minimize session exposure.
