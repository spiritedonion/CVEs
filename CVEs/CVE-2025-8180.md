## Critical Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Tenda CH22 Routers (CVE-2025-8180)

Vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices like routers pose significant risks, as they can provide attackers with deep access to a network. A critical vulnerability that allows remote code execution or denial of service, especially when an exploit is publicly available, demands immediate attention to prevent widespread compromise and ensure network integrity.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical **buffer overflow** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8180**, has been discovered in the **Tenda CH22** router, specifically in firmware version **1.0.0.1**.

The flaw resides within the `formdeleteUserName` function, which is accessible via the `/goform/deleteUserName` endpoint. The vulnerability is triggered by the improper handling of the `old_account` argument.

### Technical Cause

The **buffer overflow** occurs because the application fails to adequately validate the length of the input provided to the `old_account` argument. Supplying an excessively long string to this argument can overwrite adjacent memory buffers, corrupting data or program control flow.

This vulnerability can be exploited **remotely**, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the device or local network presence to initiate an attack. The exploit details for this vulnerability have been publicly disclosed, increasing the urgency of mitigation.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this buffer overflow could lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker may be able to inject and execute arbitrary code on the Tenda CH22 device, gaining full control over it. This could allow for network eavesdropping, device manipulation, or lateral movement within the network.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious input could cause the device's firmware to crash or become unresponsive, leading to service disruption for users connected to the router.
*   **Data Exposure:** In some buffer overflow scenarios, sensitive information stored in memory could be exposed, although RCE and DoS are the primary risks associated with this type of vulnerability.

The vulnerability's CVSS v4.0 vector `AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H` indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, even with low privileges.

### Recommendations

For Tenda CH22 users and network administrators:

*   **Immediate Action:** Given the public availability of an exploit and the critical nature of the vulnerability, it is highly recommended to immediately isolate or discontinue the use of affected Tenda CH22 1.0.0.1 devices if they are exposed to untrusted networks.
*   **Firmware Update:** Monitor the official Tenda support channels for an updated firmware version that addresses this vulnerability. Apply any security patches as soon as they become available.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Implement strong network segmentation to limit the exposure of critical network infrastructure devices. Devices like routers should ideally not be directly accessible from the public internet without strong access controls.
*   **Input Validation:** (For developers) Ensure all user-supplied inputs, especially those affecting memory operations, are thoroughly validated for length and content. Implement robust bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.
