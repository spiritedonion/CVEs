## Critical XSS Vulnerability Discovered in Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System

A new and significant security vulnerability has been identified in the **Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System**, posing a direct risk to organizations utilizing this platform. This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, and reputational damage, impacting customer trust and potentially incurring financial losses.

It is crucial for system administrators and stakeholders to understand this threat and take immediate action.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID**: **CVE-2025-8380**
*   **Affected Software**: **Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System**
*   **Affected Version**: **1.0**
*   **Vulnerability Type**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Technical Cause**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the system. Specifically, the `Name` argument in the `/admin/add_query_account.php` file does not properly sanitize user-supplied data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts directly into web pages viewed by other users, including administrators.
*   **Exploit Path**: An attacker can remotely exploit this by manipulating the `Name` parameter when interacting with the file `admin/add_query_account.php`. An example of a vulnerable path would be:
    `http://[YOUR_SYSTEM]/admin/add_query_account.php?Name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    The exploit for this vulnerability has been publicly disclosed, increasing the urgency for mitigation.

### Risk Description

An attacker who successfully exploits this Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability could:

*   **Steal Sensitive Information**: Gain access to administrator session cookies, leading to full account takeover. This could expose customer data, booking information, or other confidential operational details.
*   **Deface Websites**: Alter the appearance or content of your reservation system, eroding user trust and damaging your brand's reputation.
*   **Redirect Users**: Force users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware downloads.
*   **Execute Malicious Code**: In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could inject scripts that compromise the browsers of anyone viewing the affected page, allowing further attacks on your network.

Given that this vulnerability resides in an administrative panel, the impact of a successful exploitation could be severe, providing an attacker with broad control over your system.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual currently operating **Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System version 1.0** is immediately at risk. This includes hotels, guesthouses, travel agencies, or any other entity using this specific software for their online booking and reservation management.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**

*   **Implement Robust Input Validation**: Ensure all user-supplied input, especially for fields like `Name` in `add_query_account.php`, is strictly validated on the server-side.
*   **Apply Output Encoding**: Encode all data retrieved from the database or user input before displaying it in HTML context. This neutralizes any embedded scripts, rendering them harmless.
*   **Sanitize User Input**: Utilize secure coding practices and libraries to sanitize and filter out potentially malicious characters or scripts from all inputs.

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Assessment**: Determine if your organization is using **Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System version 1.0**.
*   **Patching**: Regularly check for and apply official security patches or updates from the software vendor. As of this advisory, a patch may not yet be available, so monitoring the reference link is crucial.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Consider deploying or configuring a WAF to help detect and block XSS attack attempts by filtering malicious input before it reaches your application.
*   **Least Privilege**: Ensure that user accounts have only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.
*   **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review web server and application logs for unusual activity or suspicious requests targeting `/admin/add_query_account.php`.
