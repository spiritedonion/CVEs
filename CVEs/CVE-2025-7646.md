## Critical Security Alert: Stored XSS Vulnerability Found in The Plus Addons for Elementor Plugin

We are issuing an urgent alert regarding a newly discovered critical vulnerability impacting **The Plus Addons for Elementor** plugin for WordPress. This security flaw could allow attackers to compromise your website, steal sensitive data, and harm your online reputation.

### Introduction: Why This Matters to Your Business

A security vulnerability in a widely used plugin can have severe consequences. Exploitation of this flaw could lead to unauthorized access to your website's data, defacement of your content, or even the injection of malicious code that impacts your visitors. For businesses, this translates directly to risks of data loss, damage to brand trust, potential financial costs associated with recovery, and compliance issues.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-7646**
*   **Affected Plugin:** **The Plus Addons for Elementor â€“ Elementor Addons, Page Templates, Widgets, Mega Menu, WooCommerce** plugin for WordPress.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **6.3.10**.
*   **Technical Cause:** This vulnerability is classified as Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It arises because the plugin does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within its `custom script` parameter. This oversight allows an authenticated attacker, even with basic Contributor-level access (or higher), to inject and save arbitrary malicious web scripts directly into your website's pages. Crucially, this can occur even when the user lacks the `unfiltered_html` capability, which is usually required for such actions.
*   **Example Injection Point:** The vulnerability resides in how the plugin handles the `custom script` parameter. An attacker could embed code like `<script>alert('Malicious Script');</script>` which would then execute for anyone viewing the compromised page.

### Risk Description: What an Attacker Could Do

If exploited, this Stored XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to:

*   **Steal Sensitive Information:** Capture user session cookies, potentially leading to full account takeover for administrators or other users.
*   **Deface Your Website:** Alter the appearance or content of pages to display malicious messages or redirect users.
*   **Spread Malware:** Inject code that attempts to install malware on the devices of website visitors.
*   **Compromise User Trust:** Damage your brand reputation by exposing visitors to malicious content or attacks.
*   **Further System Compromise:** In some scenarios, an attacker might escalate privileges or pivot to other systems within your network.

### Who is at Risk?

Any WordPress website currently using **The Plus Addons for Elementor** plugin is at risk, particularly those running versions **6.3.10** or older. Websites that allow multiple users with Contributor-level access or higher are especially vulnerable, as these users could potentially be compromised or malicious themselves.

### Recommendations: Immediate Action Required

We urge all affected users to take immediate action to protect their websites and data.

*   **For Website Owners/Admins:**
    *   **Update Immediately:** Update **The Plus Addons for Elementor** plugin to version **6.3.11** or newer without delay. This version contains the necessary security patch to address this vulnerability.
    *   **Verify Update:** After updating, clear any website caches and verify that the plugin is indeed running version 6.3.11 or higher.
    *   **Review User Accounts:** As a best practice, regularly review user accounts on your WordPress site, ensuring that only trusted individuals have the necessary access levels.

*   **For Developers:**
    *   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and output encoding for all user-supplied data, especially for parameters that could potentially contain executable code like scripts or HTML.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that functionalities which process unfiltered HTML or scripts are restricted only to users with the highest, most trusted privileges (`unfiltered_html` capability).
