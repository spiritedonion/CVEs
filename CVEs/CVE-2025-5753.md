### Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Valuation Calculator WordPress Plugin

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to web applications, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, session hijacking, or defacement. Stored XSS, specifically, is highly dangerous as malicious scripts are permanently embedded within the application's database, affecting any user who views the compromised content.

**Vulnerability Details**

A critical **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-5753**, has been discovered in the **Valuation Calculator** plugin for WordPress.

The vulnerability affects **all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2**. It stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `link` parameter. This flaw allows authenticated attackers with **Contributor-level access** or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts. These scripts are then stored in the database and execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected content.

The technical cause is the improper handling of user-supplied data. When the `link` parameter is processed, the plugin fails to adequately sanitize input to strip malicious constructs and does not properly escape output before rendering it back into the HTML, enabling script injection.

**Potential Risks**

Successful exploitation of this Stored XSS vulnerability can lead to several severe consequences, including:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies of legitimate users, including administrators, potentially leading to full site compromise.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Client-Side):** Malicious scripts can be executed in the victim's browser, performing actions on their behalf, such as changing passwords, creating new administrative users, or redirecting to phishing sites.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance or content of web pages.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive user data displayed on the page could be exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Worming:** In the context of a public-facing page, the XSS payload could spread to other users, leading to a self-propagating attack.

**Recommendations**

For site owners and developers utilizing the Valuation Calculator plugin, immediate action is crucial:

*   **Update Immediately:** Monitor the plugin's official repository for a patched version. **Update** the Valuation Calculator plugin to the latest secure version as soon as it becomes available.
*   **Disable/Remove:** If an immediate patch is not available, consider **disabling or temporarily removing** the plugin until a fix is released.
*   **Input Validation:** Developers must implement robust **input validation** for all user-supplied data, ensuring that only expected and safe characters are allowed.
*   **Output Escaping:** Always perform **output escaping** (e.g., HTML entity encoding) for all dynamic content rendered into HTML, especially data retrieved from the database or user input.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions. Review user roles and capabilities within WordPress.
