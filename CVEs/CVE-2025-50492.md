### Critical Security Alert: Session Hijacking Vulnerability in PHPGurukul e-Diary Management System (CVE-2025-50492)

For any organization using the PHPGurukul e-Diary Management System, a newly identified critical vulnerability poses a significant risk to data security and user privacy. This flaw could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical system functions, potentially leading to data breaches, reputational damage, and compliance issues.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-50492**
*   **Affected Software:** **PHPGurukul e-Diary Management System**
*   **Affected Version:** **v1**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper session invalidation within the `change-password.php` component of the system. In simple terms, when a user logs out or changes their password, the system fails to properly terminate their active session. If an attacker manages to obtain a valid session identifier (like a temporary ID card that proves you're logged in), they can continue to use it even after the legitimate user has performed an action that should have ended their session.
*   **Affected Component Path:** `/edms/change-password.php`

---

### Risk Description

This flaw enables a **session hijacking** attack. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can:

*   **Impersonate legitimate users:** Gain unauthorized access to user accounts without needing their passwords.
*   **Access sensitive data:** View, modify, or steal personal data, confidential entries, or other information stored within the e-Diary system.
*   **Perform unauthorized actions:** Execute actions as the compromised user, such as adding, deleting, or modifying entries, changing settings, or even escalating privileges if the hijacked session belongs to an administrative user.

The potential impact ranges from privacy violations to significant data breaches, depending on the role of the compromised user and the nature of the data stored.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual currently using **PHPGurukul e-Diary Management System v1** is at risk. This includes businesses, educational institutions, or personal users who rely on this system for managing diaries, notes, or other sensitive information.

---

### Recommendations

Immediate action is strongly advised to mitigate this risk.

**For Developers & IT Teams:**

*   **Implement Robust Session Management:** Ensure that all critical security actions, such as password changes, logouts, or session timeouts, explicitly invalidate the current user session on the server side. This means destroying the session ID and related data to prevent its reuse.
*   **Regenerate Session IDs:** Consider regenerating session IDs after successful authentication and any privilege escalation.
*   **Review Codebase:** Conduct a thorough security review of all authentication and session management components, specifically focusing on the `change-password.php` script and related files, to identify and rectify similar improper invalidation issues.

**For Website Owners & Administrators:**

*   **Check for Patches/Updates:** Urgently check with the PHPGurukul e-Diary Management System vendor or community for an official security patch or updated version that addresses **CVE-2025-50492**. Apply any available updates immediately.
*   **Educate Users:** Remind users about the importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks of accessing sensitive systems over untrusted networks.
*   **Monitor Activity:** Implement robust logging and monitoring for unusual login patterns or suspicious activity within the e-Diary system.
*   **Consider Temporary Mitigation (if no patch available):** If an immediate patch is not available, consider restricting access to the system to trusted networks only, or implementing multi-factor authentication if your setup allows for it, as a temporary measure.
