## Critical Vulnerability Discovered in PHPGurukul Online Library Management System v3.0

A new critical vulnerability has been identified in the **PHPGurukul Online Library Management System**, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access and data compromise. This flaw could allow attackers to hijack user sessions, potentially leading to data breaches, operational disruption, and reputational damage for organizations utilizing the affected software.

### Vulnerability Details

This newly reported vulnerability is identified by **CVE-2025-50488**.

*   **Affected Software:** **PHPGurukul Online Library Management System**
*   **Affected Version:** **v3.0**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from **improper session invalidation** within a specific component of the system. Specifically, the `change-password.php` component fails to properly terminate a user's existing session after a password change. This leaves the old session ID valid and exploitable.
*   **Affected Component Path:** `/library/change-password.php`

### Risk Description

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform **session hijacking**. By obtaining an active, but supposedly invalidated, session ID, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system as the legitimate user. This means they could view, modify, or delete data, or even take control of accounts, without needing the user's current password. The direct result is a severe breach of confidentiality, integrity, and potentially availability of the system and its data.

### Who is at Risk?

Organizations, educational institutions, or individuals currently operating **PHPGurukul Online Library Management System v3.0** are at immediate risk. Any system exposing this version to the internet, or even to a potentially compromised internal network, should consider itself vulnerable.

### Recommendations

**For Developers (of PHPGurukul Online Library Management System):**
*   Urgently implement a fix for the improper session invalidation. Ensure that upon any sensitive action, such as a password change or logout, all prior or related user sessions are explicitly terminated and invalidated on the server-side.
*   Review all session management logic across the application to prevent similar vulnerabilities.

**For System Owners and Administrators (using PHPGurukul Online Library Management System v3.0):**
*   **Prioritize Patching:** Monitor official channels from PHPGurukul for a security patch or an updated version. Apply any available update immediately. This is the most effective mitigation.
*   **Monitor Activity:** Implement robust logging and regularly review user activity logs for any suspicious or unusual behavior, especially related to account access or data modification.
*   **Access Control:** Ensure strict access controls are in place and consider limiting external exposure of the system until a patch is applied.
