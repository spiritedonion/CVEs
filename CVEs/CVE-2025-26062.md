### New Vulnerability Discovered in Intelbras RX1500 and RX3000 Routers

A critical access control vulnerability has been identified in specific versions of Intelbras RX1500 and RX3000 series routers. This flaw could allow unauthorized individuals to access sensitive configuration files, posing a significant risk to network security and user data. For businesses, this translates to potential data breaches, unauthorized network access, and reputational damage.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-26062**
*   **Affected Software:** Intelbras RX1500 and Intelbras RX3000 series routers.
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Intelbras RX1500 **v2.2.9**
    *   Intelbras RX3000 **v1.0.11**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper access control mechanism. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to directly access the router's settings file without requiring any login credentials. This file contains the current configuration details of the device.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this **access control issue** could allow an attacker to obtain highly **sensitive information** from your router's configuration. This potentially includes network credentials, Wi-Fi passwords, administrative passwords, DNS settings, and other critical network parameters. With this information, an attacker could:

*   Gain unauthorized access to your internal network.
*   Reroute your internet traffic (DNS hijacking).
*   Install malicious firmware or software.
*   Launch further attacks against connected devices or users.
*   Exfiltrate data passing through the router.

### Who is At Risk

Any individual or organization utilizing Intelbras **RX1500** (specifically version **v2.2.9**) or **RX3000** (specifically version **v1.0.11**) routers is at risk. This includes small businesses, home offices, and any environment where these devices are deployed.

### Recommendations

**For Developers (Intelbras):**

*   Prioritize a patch that implements robust authentication and authorization checks for all file access, especially configuration files.
*   Ensure that sensitive files are not directly accessible without proper session validation.
*   Review all existing access control mechanisms within the firmware to prevent similar vulnerabilities.

**For Website Owners/Admins (Users of Intelbras Routers):**

*   **Check Firmware Version:** Immediately verify the firmware version of your Intelbras RX1500 and RX3000 routers.
*   **Update Firmware:** As soon as an official patch is released by Intelbras, update your router's firmware to the latest secure version.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate critical systems on a separate network segment if possible, reducing the blast radius of a potential compromise.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Ensure all administrative interfaces for your router and other network devices use strong, unique passwords.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review router logs for any unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts.
