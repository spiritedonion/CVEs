**Mitel SIP Phones: Unauthenticated File Upload Vulnerability**

This write-up details a critical vulnerability identified in several Mitel SIP phone series. Understanding such vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of communication infrastructure, as even seemingly minor flaws can lead to resource exhaustion or indicate fundamental security weaknesses in device management.

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-47187**
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Mitel 6800 Series SIP Phones
    *   Mitel 6900 Series SIP Phones
    *   Mitel 6900w Series SIP Phones
    *   Mitel 6970 Conference Unit
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability impacts devices through **6.4 SP4**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from **missing authentication mechanisms** on the devices. This absence of proper authentication allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform an arbitrary file upload. Specifically, the system permits the upload of **WAV files** without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **Potential Risks:** A successful exploit could lead to the **exhaustion of the phone's storage**. While the vendor notes this may not directly affect the phone's availability or operation, the ability for an unauthenticated attacker to arbitrarily fill device storage represents a significant resource exhaustion risk and highlights a critical security oversight.

**Recommendations**

Mitel users and administrators are strongly advised to:

*   Review official security advisories from Mitel promptly for updates related to this CVE.
*   Apply all available patches or firmware updates as soon as they are released to address this and any other identified vulnerabilities.
*   Implement network segmentation and access controls to limit direct exposure of Mitel devices to untrusted networks.
