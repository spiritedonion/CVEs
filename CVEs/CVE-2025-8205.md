## Vulnerability in Comodo Dragon's IP DNS Leakage Detector

Transmitting sensitive information in cleartext poses a significant risk, allowing attackers to intercept and read private data without encryption. Such vulnerabilities can compromise user privacy and expose network details, even when users believe their connections are secure.

### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-8205**, has been identified in **Comodo Dragon** browser versions up to `134.0.6998.179`. The issue lies within an **unknown functionality** of the browser's **IP DNS Leakage Detector** component.

### Technical Cause

The core of the vulnerability is the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**. During the operation of the IP DNS Leakage Detector, certain data is sent without encryption. This allows an attacker, who can intercept network traffic, to capture and read the sensitive information being transmitted. While the exact functionality leading to this leakage is not specified, the outcome is a direct exposure of potentially private user or network data.

### Potential Risks

The primary risk is **data exposure**. Attackers could potentially intercept DNS queries, user IP addresses, or other network-related information that the IP DNS Leakage Detector processes. This compromise can lead to:

*   **Privacy violations:** Revealing user browsing habits or location.
*   **Network reconnaissance:** Gaining insights into a user's network configuration or target systems.
*   **Further attacks:** Using the exposed information to plan more targeted attacks.

### Attack Vector and Severity

The vulnerability can be exploited **remotely**. While the attack complexity is rated as **high** and exploitation is considered difficult, a public exploit (Proof-of-Concept) is known to exist. The CVSS v4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is **6.3 (Medium)**, with the vector string `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X`. The vendor was contacted about this disclosure but did not respond.

### Recommendations

For users of **Comodo Dragon**, it is strongly recommended to:

*   **Update immediately:** Upgrade **Comodo Dragon** to a version greater than `134.0.6998.179` as soon as a patch is available.
*   **Exercise caution:** Until an update is applied, be aware that sensitive network information might be exposed. Consider using alternative browsers or VPNs that ensure end-to-end encryption for all traffic, especially when handling sensitive data.
*   **Monitor vendor announcements:** Stay informed about official updates and security advisories from Comodo.
