# Critical Security Alert: Vulnerability in AZIOT Smart Wi-Fi CCTV Cameras

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in a widely used smart CCTV camera, posing a significant risk to the privacy and security of home and business networks. This flaw could allow unauthorized individuals to gain deep access to your network, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, and further attacks.

## Vulnerability Details

A newly discovered security flaw, tracked as **CVE-2025-50777**, affects the firmware of the **AZIOT 2MP Full HD Smart Wi-Fi CCTV Home Security Camera**. Specifically, devices running firmware **V1.00.02** are susceptible to this critical issue.

The vulnerability stems from an "Incorrect Access Control" flaw. In simple terms, this means that the camera's firmware does not properly restrict access to its internal system. A local attacker – someone with direct access to the device or the same local network – can exploit this flaw to gain "root shell access." This is the highest level of administrative control over the camera.

Once root access is achieved, the device shockingly exposes critical sensitive data in plaintext. This includes your **Wi-Fi credentials** (your network password) and **ONVIF service credentials**.

## Risk Description

Exploitation of this vulnerability carries severe consequences:

*   **Network Compromise:** An attacker can steal your Wi-Fi password, allowing them to join your home or business network without authorization. This gives them access to all other devices connected to that network, including computers, servers, smart devices, and other IoT gadgets.
*   **Data Theft:** With access to your network and ONVIF credentials, attackers can potentially monitor other cameras, steal sensitive data, or even install malware on connected systems.
*   **Privacy Invasion:** Beyond network compromise, the very purpose of a security camera is undermined. Attackers could gain control over the camera itself, potentially viewing live feeds or manipulating its functions.
*   **Further Attacks:** The compromised camera can serve as a launchpad for broader attacks within your network, impacting business operations, financial data, and personal privacy.

## Who is at Risk

Any individual or organization currently using the **AZIOT 2MP Full HD Smart Wi-Fi CCTV Home Security Camera** with firmware **V1.00.02** is at immediate risk. This applies to cameras deployed in homes, small businesses, offices, or any environment where the device is accessible via the local network.

## Recommendations

It is crucial to take immediate action to mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability.

**For Developers (AZIOT):**
*   **Prioritize a Patch:** Immediately develop and release a firmware update that addresses the Incorrect Access Control vulnerability.
*   **Secure Credential Storage:** Implement robust security measures for storing sensitive data like Wi-Fi and ONVIF credentials. They must never be stored in plaintext. Employ strong encryption and secure key management practices.
*   **Comprehensive Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security audit of the entire device firmware to identify and rectify any other potential vulnerabilities.

**For Camera Owners/Admins:**
*   **Check Firmware Version:** Verify the firmware version of your **AZIOT 2MP Full HD Smart Wi-Fi CCTV Home Security Camera**. If it is **V1.00.02**, your device is vulnerable.
*   **Isolate or Disconnect:** Until a patch is available and applied, consider isolating the affected camera from your main network or, if possible, disconnecting it entirely. If isolation isn't feasible, place it on a segmented guest network.
*   **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the official AZIOT website or your camera's app for firmware updates. Apply any available patches immediately upon release.
*   **Change Wi-Fi Passwords:** If your camera was connected to your primary Wi-Fi network and is vulnerable, it is highly recommended to change your Wi-Fi password immediately, as it may have been compromised.
*   **Review Network Security:** Implement network segmentation where possible to limit the impact of a compromised IoT device. Ensure strong, unique passwords for all devices on your network.
