## Critical Vulnerability in **vproxy** Proxy Server Affects Versions 2.3.3 and Below

A newly discovered critical vulnerability in the **vproxy** proxy server could lead to significant operational disruptions for organizations. This flaw, if exploited, can cause **vproxy** instances to crash, rendering services unavailable and potentially impacting business continuity and user experience.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-54581**, has been found in the **vproxy** HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy server. This flaw affects all versions up to and including **2.3.3**.

The issue stems from how **vproxy** processes untrusted data within the HTTP **Proxy-Authorization** header. Specifically, if an attacker crafts a malicious username that includes a 'Time-to-Live' (TTL) value of zero, such as `configuredUser-ttl-0`, it can lead to a division by zero error within the server's code. This error causes the **vproxy** server process to crash unexpectedly.

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**. An attacker can repeatedly crash vulnerable **vproxy** instances, making the proxy service – and any applications relying on it – completely unavailable. This can disrupt critical operations, impact user access, and lead to significant downtime for services routed through **vproxy**.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual operating a **vproxy** server for HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5 proxying is at risk, particularly those running versions **2.3.3** or older. This includes environments where **vproxy** is used for internal network routing, public-facing proxy services, or any application gateway.

### Recommendations

Immediate action is required to mitigate this vulnerability:

**For System Administrators and IT Teams:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The vulnerability is patched in **vproxy** version **2.4.0**. All users of **vproxy** are strongly advised to upgrade their installations to version **2.4.0** or later without delay.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Even after patching, monitor **vproxy** logs for unusual activity or repeated crashes, which could indicate attempted exploitation.
