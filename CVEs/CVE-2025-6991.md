## Critical Local File Inclusion in Kallyas WordPress Theme

Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities are a significant concern in web applications, as they can lead to severe consequences, including the execution of arbitrary code and sensitive data exposure. When combined with the ability to upload files, LFI can directly result in **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, allowing attackers to take full control of the compromised system.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-6991**, has been discovered in the **Kallyas theme** for WordPress.

*   **Affected Software:** Kallyas theme for WordPress.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **4.21.0**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability resides within the `TH_LatestPosts4` widget. This insecure implementation allows authenticated attackers to manipulate input parameters to include and execute arbitrary `.php` files from the server's file system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation requires **authenticated access**, specifically with **Contributor-level access** or higher. An attacker can leverage this flaw if they can also upload a malicious `.php` file (e.g., via other functionalities like media uploads if not properly restricted, or a separate vulnerability).
*   **Conceptual Payload:**
    The vulnerability likely stems from unsanitized user input passed to a file inclusion function. While the exact payload is not provided, a common pattern for exploitation might involve a path traversal leading to a user-controlled file:
    `[theme_root]/[vulnerable_file].php?param=../../path/to/uploaded/shell.php`
    where `param` is the vulnerable input in the `TH_LatestPosts4` widget.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this LFI vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If attackers can upload a malicious `.php` file (such as a web shell) to the server, they can then include and execute it, gaining arbitrary command execution capabilities on the compromised system.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** Attackers could include sensitive configuration files (e.g., `wp-config.php`) or other crucial PHP files to bypass intended security restrictions and gain unauthorized access to data or functionalities.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Critical server files containing database credentials, API keys, user information, or other confidential data could be included and their contents disclosed to the attacker.

### Recommendations

*   **For Site Owners:**
    *   **Immediate Update:** Urgently update the Kallyas theme to the latest available version beyond 4.21.0. This is the most crucial step to mitigate the risk.
    *   **Review User Permissions:** Strictly review and limit user permissions, especially file upload capabilities for users with Contributor roles and below, to minimize the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Maintain regular, verified backups of your website data and database.
*   **For Developers (General LFI Prevention):**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Always sanitize and validate all user-supplied input, especially when used in file system operations. Avoid directly using user input in file paths.
    *   **Whitelisting:** Implement strict whitelisting for file inclusion. Only allow specific, predefined files to be included, rejecting any other paths.
    *   **Disable PHP Execution in Upload Directories:** Configure web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to prevent PHP script execution in directories where user-uploaded content is stored (e.g., `wp-content/uploads`).
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the web server process runs with the least necessary privileges to limit the potential damage in case of a compromise.
