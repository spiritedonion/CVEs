### Kallyas WordPress Theme Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities pose significant risks to web applications, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or complete system compromise. When exploited, LFI allows attackers to read or execute arbitrary files on the server, bypassing intended access controls.

**Vulnerability Details**

A critical Local File Inclusion vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-6991**, has been discovered in the Kallyas theme for WordPress.

*   **Affected Software:** Kallyas Theme for WordPress
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, `4.21.0`.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability resides within the **`TH_LatestPosts4`** widget. This component improperly handles file inclusion requests, allowing an attacker to specify and include arbitrary `.php` files from the server's file system.
*   **Prerequisites:** Exploitation requires an **authenticated attacker** with at least **Contributor-level access** or higher.

**Potential Risks**

Successful exploitation of this LFI vulnerability can lead to severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can also upload arbitrary `.php` files (e.g., through another vulnerability or a legitimate but misconfigured feature), they can include these uploaded files and execute any PHP code within them, achieving full RCE on the server.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can read critical server files, such as configuration files (e.g., `wp-config.php`), sensitive user data, or system logs, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** By including specific application files, attackers may be able to bypass intended security restrictions or gain unauthorized access to functionalities.

**Recommendations**

For site owners and developers using the Kallyas theme:

*   **Update Immediately:** Monitor for and apply the latest security patches for the Kallyas theme as soon as they become available. Ensure your theme version is updated beyond `4.21.0`.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict user roles to the minimum necessary privileges required for their tasks.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict server-side validation and sanitization for all user-supplied input, especially when dealing with file paths or inclusion parameters.
*   **File Upload Restrictions:** If file uploads are permitted, ensure that only trusted file types can be uploaded and that they are stored in non-executable directories.
