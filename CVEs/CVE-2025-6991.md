## Local File Inclusion Vulnerability in Kallyas WordPress Theme

Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities represent a significant risk to web applications, potentially allowing attackers to read sensitive files, bypass security controls, and, in severe cases, execute arbitrary code on the server. Addressing such flaws promptly is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of web systems.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-6991**, has been discovered in the Kallyas theme for WordPress.

The vulnerability affects **all versions** of the Kallyas theme up to, and including, **4.21.0**.

The technical cause stems from improper input validation within the **`TH_LatestPosts4`** widget. This flaw allows authenticated attackers, specifically those with **Contributor-level access or higher**, to include and execute arbitrary `.php` files present on the server.

### Potential Risks

Exploitation of this LFI vulnerability can lead to several severe outcomes:

*   **Bypass of access controls**: Attackers can potentially circumvent security measures.
*   **Sensitive data exposure**: Confidential information stored in server files could be disclosed.
*   **Arbitrary PHP code execution**: If an attacker can upload a `.php` file (e.g., through another vulnerability or misconfiguration), they can execute any PHP code within that file, leading to **complete system compromise** (Remote Code Execution).

### Recommendations

Site owners and developers using the Kallyas theme are strongly advised to take immediate action:

*   **Update Immediately**: Upgrade the Kallyas theme to the latest patched version as soon as it becomes available. If a patch is not yet released, consider temporarily deactivating the theme or applying a temporary mitigation if feasible.
*   **Restrict File Uploads**: Implement strict controls on file uploads, ensuring that only necessary and safe file types can be uploaded.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that user accounts, especially those with Contributor or higher roles, are only granted the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct routine security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.
