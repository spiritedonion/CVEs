## Kallyas WordPress Theme Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities are critical security flaws that can allow attackers to read sensitive data, bypass access controls, and, in severe cases, execute arbitrary code on a server. Such vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of a web application and its underlying infrastructure.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-6991**, has been discovered in the **kallyas theme** for **WordPress**. This flaw affects all versions of the theme up to, and including, **4.21.0**.

The vulnerability resides within the `TH_LatestPosts4` widget. Attackers who possess **authenticated access** at the **Contributor-level or above** can exploit this weakness. By manipulating the widget's parameters, they can include and execute arbitrary `.php` files present on the server.

### Technical Cause

The `TH_LatestPosts4` widget fails to adequately sanitize or validate user-supplied input when referencing file paths. This oversight allows an attacker to specify a path to any `.php` file on the server's file system, which the application then attempts to include and execute.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this LFI vulnerability can lead to severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can upload a `.php` file to the server (e.g., via another vulnerability, a legitimate file upload feature, or by exploiting writable directories), they can then use this LFI vulnerability to execute the uploaded malicious PHP code. This grants the attacker full control over the compromised WordPress site and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files (`wp-config.php`), log files, or other system files, potentially exposing database credentials, API keys, and other confidential information.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** By including specific PHP files, attackers might be able to bypass existing security measures or gain unauthorized access to administrative functions.

### Recommendations

Site owners and developers using the kallyas theme are strongly advised to take immediate action:

*   **Update Immediately:** Upgrade the kallyas theme to the latest available version that patches this vulnerability as soon as a fix is released by the theme developer.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that all user accounts, especially those with Contributor-level access or higher, operate under the Principle of Least Privilege, granting only the necessary permissions required for their roles.
*   **File Upload Security:** Implement robust security measures for file uploads, including strict validation of file types and contents, and storing uploaded files outside the web root if possible.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and vulnerability scans of your WordPress installations to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.
