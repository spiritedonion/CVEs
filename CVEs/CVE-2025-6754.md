## Critical Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Found in **SEO Metrics WordPress Plugin**

A significant security vulnerability has been discovered in the **SEO Metrics plugin** for WordPress. This flaw, if exploited, could allow low-privileged users to gain full administrative control over your website. For businesses, this translates to severe risks including data breaches, website defacement, and potential loss of customer trust and revenue. Immediate action is required to protect your digital assets.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-6754**
*   **Affected Software:** **SEO Metrics plugin** for WordPress
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions **1.0.5** through **1.0.15**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks within the plugin's code. Specifically, two functions, `seo_metrics_handle_connect_button_click()` (an AJAX handler) and `seo_metrics_handle_custom_endpoint()`, fail to properly verify if the user attempting to access them has the required permissions. While a "nonce" (a unique, temporary security token) is checked, this is not enough to ensure only authorized users can perform sensitive actions. This oversight allows a low-privileged user (such as a subscriber) to bypass intended security measures.
*   **Example Paths (Conceptual):**
    *   An attacker, acting as a subscriber, could initiate a request to the vulnerable AJAX handler to retrieve a token:
        `POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=seo_metrics_handle_connect_button_click`
    *   With this token, they can then access a sensitive custom endpoint to gain administrator cookies:
        `GET /wp-json/seo-metrics/v1/custom-endpoint`

### Risk Description

This **privilege escalation** vulnerability is critical. If exploited, an attacker could elevate their privileges from a basic subscriber to a full site administrator. With administrative access, they could:

*   Completely take control of your WordPress website.
*   Install malicious plugins or themes.
*   Steal sensitive data, including user information.
*   Deface your website or redirect visitors to malicious sites.
*   Disrupt your online operations, leading to significant financial and reputational damage.

### Who is at Risk

Any WordPress website currently using the **SEO Metrics plugin** in versions **1.0.5** through **1.0.15** is immediately at risk. This includes personal blogs, e-commerce stores, corporate websites, and any other site relying on this specific plugin within the vulnerable version range.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners/Administrators:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The most crucial step is to update your **SEO Metrics plugin** to the latest available secure version as soon as a patch is released. Check your WordPress dashboard for plugin updates.
*   **Temporary Mitigation (If No Patch):** If an immediate patch is not available, consider temporarily deactivating the **SEO Metrics plugin** until a secure update can be applied. Understand that deactivating it may impact functionalities relying on the plugin.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review your website access logs for unusual activity, especially related to new user registrations or privilege changes.

**For Developers (of the SEO Metrics Plugin):**

*   **Implement Robust Capability Checks:** Ensure that all AJAX handlers and custom endpoints that perform sensitive operations include explicit capability checks (e.g., `current_user_can('manage_options')` or similar WordPress capabilities) in addition to nonce verification.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design functions to only grant the minimum necessary permissions required for their operation.
