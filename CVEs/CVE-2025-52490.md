**Critical Vulnerability Discovered in Couchbase Sync Gateway: Cleartext Passwords in Logs**

A critical security vulnerability has been discovered in **Couchbase Sync Gateway**, posing a significant risk of exposing sensitive user passwords. This flaw could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and severe reputational and financial damage for organizations. Immediate action is required to protect your systems.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-52490**
*   **Affected Software:** **Couchbase Sync Gateway**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to **3.2.6**

This vulnerability arises from an oversight in the logging mechanisms of **Couchbase Sync Gateway**. User passwords are inadvertently recorded in cleartext within two specific log files: `sgcollect_info_options.log` and `sync_gateway.log`. This issue persists even when logging is configured for redaction, meaning the 'redaction' feature fails to obfuscate these critical password entries. If an attacker gains access to these log files, they can directly read sensitive credentials.

### Risk Description

If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker who gains access to the affected log files could readily extract user passwords. With these credentials, they could:

*   Gain **unauthorized access** to connected Couchbase databases and applications.
*   Steal sensitive **data**, leading to a significant **data breach**.
*   Potentially **compromise connected systems** or move laterally within your network.
*   Cause **operational disruption** and erode customer trust.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization utilizing **Couchbase Sync Gateway** in their application architecture is at risk. This includes businesses powering mobile applications, IoT solutions, or any system that relies on Sync Gateway for data synchronization with Couchbase Mobile. Companies with less stringent log file access controls or those not regularly monitoring log integrity are particularly vulnerable.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**

*   Review and enforce secure coding practices for handling sensitive data. Ensure that credentials and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are never logged in cleartext.
*   Implement robust redaction or encryption for all sensitive log data.
*   Thoroughly test logging configurations to confirm sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed.

**For Website Owners / System Administrators:**

*   **Urgent Update:** Immediately update your **Couchbase Sync Gateway** deployments to **version 3.2.6** or the latest available version. This is the primary and most effective mitigation.
*   **Secure Log Files:** Implement strict file system permissions on your servers to restrict access to log directories and files.
*   **Monitor Log Access:** Deploy log monitoring solutions to detect unusual access patterns or unauthorized attempts to read log files.
*   **Credential Rotation:** As a precautionary measure, consider rotating user credentials that might have been processed by affected Sync Gateway instances.
