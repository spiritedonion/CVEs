### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-6681**
*   **Affected Software:** **Fan Page plugin for WordPress**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **1.0.1**
*   **Technical Cause:** This vulnerability is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue. It stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping related to the `width` parameter. This means the plugin does not properly clean or neutralize user-supplied data before saving it to the database and then displaying it on a webpage. An attacker can embed malicious scripts within the `width` parameter, which then become a permanent part of the page content.
*   **Exploitation Example:** An attacker could inject malicious script code via the `width` parameter, such as: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When an unsuspecting user views the affected page, this script would execute in their browser.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this Stored XSS vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker, specifically one with **Contributor-level access or higher**, to inject arbitrary web scripts into your website. These scripts will execute in the browsers of any user who visits the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Website Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of your site.
*   **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information from users viewing the compromised page.
*   **Redirecting Users:** Forcing visitors to malicious websites.
*   **Installing Malware:** Tricking users into downloading malicious software.

### Who is at Risk

Any **WordPress website** currently using the **Fan Page plugin** in versions up to and including **1.0.1** is at risk. While this vulnerability requires an authenticated attacker with at least Contributor-level access, many organizations grant such roles to multiple individuals, increasing the attack surface. It is critical for all site owners using this plugin to assess their risk.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** Check for an official patch or updated version of the **Fan Page plugin**. Update your plugin to the latest secure version as soon as it becomes available.
*   **Deactivation/Removal:** If no patch is immediately available, or if you do not actively use the plugin's features, consider deactivating or temporarily removing the **Fan Page plugin** until a secure version is released.
*   **User Permissions Review:** Regularly review user roles and permissions on your WordPress site, especially those with Contributor-level access or higher.

**For Developers (of the Fan Page Plugin or similar software):**

*   **Input Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially parameters that can influence output like `width`.
*   **Output Escaping:** Ensure all user-generated content is properly escaped before being rendered on a webpage to prevent script execution. Use appropriate escaping functions (e.g., `wp_kses()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_html()`) for the context in which the data is displayed.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.
