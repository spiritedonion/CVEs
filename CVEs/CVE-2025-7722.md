### Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Social Streams WordPress Plugin

Privilege escalation vulnerabilities are critical as they allow attackers to gain higher access levels than intended, potentially leading to full site compromise. This type of flaw can turn a low-privileged user into an administrator, posing a severe risk to the integrity and security of a WordPress installation.

**Vulnerability Details**

A critical **privilege escalation** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-7722**, has been discovered in the **Social Streams** plugin for WordPress. This flaw affects **all versions** of the plugin up to, and including, **1.0.1**.

**Technical Cause**

The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly validate a user's identity before processing requests to update user meta information. Specifically, the `update_user_meta()` function within the plugin does not implement sufficient authorization checks. This allows any authenticated attacker, even those with **Subscriber-level access** or above, to manipulate their user meta data. By doing so, they can modify their own user type, effectively elevating their privileges to that of an **administrator**.

The problematic code is located within the plugin's API handling, as indicated by the reference pointing to `src/php/JsonAPI.php`.

**Potential Risks**

The primary risk is **full site takeover**. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can:

*   Gain **administrator-level access** to the WordPress site.
*   Install or modify plugins and themes, potentially leading to **remote code execution**.
*   Access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   Deface the website or inject malicious content.
*   Create new administrative users.

**Recommendations**

For site owners and developers using the Social Streams plugin, immediate action is advised:

*   **Update:** Check for an official patched version of the Social Streams plugin. If available, update immediately to secure your site.
*   **Deactivate/Remove:** If no patched version is available, it is strongly recommended to **deactivate** and remove the Social Streams plugin until a security fix is released.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure all user accounts operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Developer Guidance:** Developers should implement robust **identity validation** and **authorization checks** for all actions that modify sensitive user data or privileges, adhering to the principle of "never trust user input."
