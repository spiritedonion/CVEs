## Kallyas WordPress Theme Arbitrary Folder Deletion Vulnerability

Arbitrary file or folder deletion vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, ranging from denial of service to irreversible data loss. By allowing unauthorized users to remove critical server components or data, these flaws pose a significant risk to system integrity and availability.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-6989`
*   **Affected Component:** The **Kallyas theme** for WordPress.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions **up to and including 4.21.0**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from **insufficient file path validation** within the `delete_font()` function. This flaw allows an attacker to supply a crafted path, enabling the function to delete directories outside its intended scope on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** This issue can be exploited by **authenticated attackers** with at least **Contributor-level access**.

### Potential Risks

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could delete critical system directories, core WordPress files, or essential plugin/theme files, rendering the website or even the entire server inoperable.
*   **Data Loss:** Important configuration files, user uploads, or database backups could be permanently deleted.
*   **System Instability:** Deleting specific application or server directories might lead to instability or unpredictable behavior.

### Recommendations

*   **Update Immediately:** Site owners and developers using the Kallyas theme should **update to the latest patched version** as soon as it becomes available.
*   **Input Validation:** Developers should implement **strict server-side input validation** for all file and folder path operations. This ensures that user-supplied paths are confined to expected directories and do not contain directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that user accounts only have the minimum necessary permissions required for their tasks, limiting the potential impact of a compromised account.
