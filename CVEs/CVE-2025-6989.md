## Arbitrary Folder Deletion Vulnerability in Kallyas WordPress Theme

Vulnerabilities in widely used WordPress themes can lead to significant compromise of web applications and underlying server infrastructure. Insufficient validation of user-supplied input, particularly concerning file system operations, poses a critical risk, potentially leading to data loss or service disruption.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-6989**, has been identified in the **Kallyas theme for WordPress**.

*   **Affected Software:** Kallyas theme for WordPress.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **4.21.0**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from **insufficient file path validation** within the theme's `delete_font()` function. This inadequate validation allows an attacker to manipulate the file path argument, enabling the deletion of directories outside the intended scope.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation requires **authenticated access** with at least **Contributor-level privileges** or higher.
*   **Potential Risks:** Successful exploitation results in **arbitrary folder deletion** on the server. This can lead to a **denial of service (DoS)** by removing critical system directories, configuration files, or sensitive application data. Depending on the targeted directories, this could also facilitate further attacks by disrupting security logging or removing essential components.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**
Implement **robust file path validation** in all functions that interact with the file system. Employ a **whitelisting approach** for allowed paths and file types. Utilize functions that resolve and sanitize paths (e.g., `realpath()`, `basename()`) to prevent directory traversal attacks. Never directly use user-supplied input in file system operations without strict validation and sanitization.

**For Site Owners:**
*   Immediately **update the Kallyas theme** to the latest patched version once it becomes available.
*   If an immediate patch is not available, consider temporarily **disabling the theme** or implementing a security rule (e.g., via a Web Application Firewall) to block requests to the vulnerable `delete_font()` function.
*   Regularly **back up** your WordPress site files and database to mitigate data loss in case of a successful attack.
