### Kallyas WordPress Theme: Arbitrary Folder Deletion Vulnerability

Arbitrary folder deletion vulnerabilities are critical as they can lead to severe data loss, website defacement, and service disruption. Such flaws allow attackers to remove essential files or directories, potentially rendering a website or even the entire server inoperable.

#### Vulnerability Details

A critical vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-6989**, has been identified in the **Kallyas WordPress theme**. This flaw permits authenticated attackers to delete arbitrary folders on the server.

The vulnerability stems from **insufficient file path validation** within the `delete_font()` function. This inadequate validation allows an attacker to manipulate the input path, instructing the function to delete any directory accessible to the web server process, rather than being restricted to intended theme-specific folders.

This attack requires **authenticated access**, specifically with **Contributor-level privileges** or higher.

#### Affected Software and Versions

*   **Software:** Kallyas WordPress theme
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions **up to and including 4.21.0**

#### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to several severe consequences:

*   **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete critical website data, including user uploads, configuration files, or other sensitive information stored in folders.
*   **Service Disruption:** Deleting core WordPress folders, theme/plugin directories, or web server configuration folders can render the entire website or even the web server inoperable.
*   **Website Defacement:** By deleting specific content folders, an attacker could deface the website.
*   **Further Exploitation:** While not directly enabling remote code execution, arbitrary folder deletion can be a precursor to more advanced attacks by removing security measures or clearing logs.

#### Recommendations for Developers and Site Owners

*   **Immediate Update:** Site owners using the Kallyas theme should **immediately update to the latest patched version** as soon as it becomes available. This is the most effective mitigation.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that all user accounts, especially those with Contributor-level access, genuinely require the privileges they possess. Reduce privileges where possible.
*   **Backup Strategy:** Maintain regular and robust backups of your website and server data to facilitate rapid recovery in case of an incident.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools to detect unauthorized changes or deletions of critical files and folders on your server.
