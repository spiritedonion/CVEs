## Kallyas Theme Arbitrary Folder Deletion Vulnerability

Arbitrary folder deletion vulnerabilities are critical as they can lead to severe disruption of web services, data loss, and potentially open pathways for further system compromise. The ability for an attacker to remove critical directories can render a website inoperable or expose sensitive information.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical security vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-6989**, has been discovered in the **Kallyas theme** for WordPress. This flaw permits **arbitrary folder deletion** on the server.

The vulnerability stems from **insufficient file path validation** within the `delete_font()` function. An authenticated attacker, requiring a **Contributor-level role or higher**, can exploit this weakness to delete any folder on the underlying server.

### Affected Versions

All versions of the Kallyas theme up to, and including, **4.21.0**, are impacted by this vulnerability.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Deleting critical application or system folders can crash the website or render it completely inaccessible.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could delete theme or plugin files, altering the site's appearance or functionality.
*   **Data Loss:** While not directly deleting user data, the removal of configuration or database-related directories could lead to data integrity issues or loss.
*   **Further Compromise:** In certain scenarios, deleting specific directories could disrupt security measures or enable other attack vectors.

### Recommendations

Developers and site owners using the Kallyas theme are strongly advised to take immediate action:

1.  **Update Immediately:** Upgrade the Kallyas theme to the latest available version that patches this vulnerability.
2.  **Input Validation:** Ensure all file path inputs are rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal or arbitrary file operations.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict user permissions to the minimum necessary for their roles. If Contributor-level users do not require font management capabilities, restrict access to such functions.
