# Urgent Security Alert: Critical SSRF Vulnerability in **GLPI** Software

A significant security vulnerability has been discovered and patched in **GLPI**, the widely used Free Asset and IT Management Software. This flaw, classified as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), poses a direct risk to your organization's internal network security and sensitive data. For non-technical stakeholders, this means an attacker could potentially trick your **GLPI** server into accessing internal systems that should not be publicly exposed, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or even broader system compromise.

## Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-52567**
*   **Affected Software:** **GLPI** (Free Asset and IT Management Software, Data Center Management, ITIL Service Desk, Licenses Tracking, Software Auditing)
*   **Affected Version Numbers:** All versions from **0.84** through **10.0.18**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insufficient validation of URLs used when **GLPI** processes RSS feeds or external calendars within its planning features. An attacker could craft a malicious URL, tricking the **GLPI** server into making requests to arbitrary internal network resources or external services on the attacker's behalf. This bypasses previous security patches, highlighting the criticality of the new fix.

## Risk Description

If exploited, this SSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

*   **Access Internal Systems:** Scan internal network ports, enumerate services, or interact with sensitive internal applications that are normally isolated from the internet.
*   **Steal Sensitive Data:** Retrieve information from internal APIs, databases, or cloud metadata services that are accessible from the **GLPI** server.
*   **Bypass Firewalls:** Use the **GLPI** server as a proxy to circumvent firewall rules, gaining a foothold into your private network.
*   **Launch Further Attacks:** Potentially execute commands, install malware, or pivot to other systems within your infrastructure.

The ultimate impact could range from significant data breaches to complete system compromise and operational disruption.

## Who is at Risk

Any organization currently using **GLPI** for IT asset management, service desk operations, or data center management is at risk, especially if running any version between **0.84** and **10.0.18**. This includes small businesses to large enterprises relying on **GLPI** for critical IT infrastructure oversight.

## Recommendations

Immediate action is required to secure your **GLPI** installations.

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The most crucial step is to **IMMEDIATELY update your GLPI installation to version 10.0.19 or higher**. This version contains the robust patch addressing this vulnerability.
*   **Backup Before Update:** Always perform a full backup of your **GLPI** installation and database before initiating any major update.
*   **Test in Staging:** If possible, test the update in a staging environment mirroring your production setup to ensure compatibility and functionality.
*   **Monitor Logs:** After updating, review your **GLPI** and server access logs for any unusual activity or connection attempts that may indicate prior exploitation.

**For Developers and IT Teams (Beyond Patching):**

*   **Input Validation:** Ensure all user-supplied URLs are rigorously validated against a strict whitelist of allowed domains and protocols, rather than relying on blacklists.
*   **Least Privilege:** Configure **GLPI** and its underlying server with the principle of least privilege, limiting network access from the **GLPI** application to only essential resources.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Implement strong network segmentation to limit what internal systems the **GLPI** server can access, even if compromised.
