## Critical Vulnerability Found in Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8 Devices

Default credentials and weak password policies represent significant security risks, opening doors for unauthorized access. For connected devices like dashcams, this could mean compromised privacy, misuse of stored data, or even manipulation of device settings, impacting both individuals and organizations.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8** devices.

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-30125**
*   **Affected Software:** **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8**
*   **Affected Versions:** All **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8** devices shipped.
*   **Technical Cause:** The core issue stems from two factors:
    1.  **Insecure Default Credentials:** All devices are shipped with the same hardcoded default password: `12345678`. This "insecure-by-default" configuration makes devices immediately vulnerable upon setup if the password isn't changed.
    2.  **Weak Password Policy:** Even when users attempt to change the password, the system enforces a maximum length of only 8 characters. This severely limits password strength.
*   **Exploitation Potential:** The combination of a known default password and a short maximum password length makes brute-force attacks highly effective. As noted in the advisory, these short passwords can be cracked in approximately 8 hours using low-cost commercial cloud resources.

### Risk Description

If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the dashcam. This could lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Privacy Breach:** Unauthorized viewing of live video feeds or stored recordings, compromising the privacy of individuals or sensitive operational data.
*   **Data Tampering:** Deletion or modification of crucial video evidence, potentially hindering investigations or legal processes.
*   **Device Manipulation:** Unauthorized changes to device settings or configurations, disrupting normal operation or facilitating further attacks.

### Who is at Risk

Any individual or organization currently using **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8** devices is directly at risk. This is particularly true for those who have not changed the default password, or who have set a new password that is easily guessable or adheres to the vulnerable 8-character limit.

### Recommendations

**For Marbella KR8s Dashcam Owners/Users:**

*   **Immediate Password Change:** If you are using a **Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8** device, immediately change the default password `12345678`.
*   **Strong Passwords:** While constrained by the 8-character limit, choose the strongest possible 8-character password. Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid personal information, common words, or simple sequences.
*   **Monitor Activity:** Be vigilant for any unusual activity related to your dashcam or associated accounts.

**For Marbella Developers/Manufacturers:**

*   **Urgent Firmware Update:** Develop and release a firmware update that forces users to change the default password upon initial setup or first boot. This should be a mandatory step that cannot be skipped.
*   **Enhanced Password Policy:** Implement a significantly stronger password policy. This should include a greater minimum password length (e.g., 12-16 characters) and requirements for complexity (mixed case, numbers, symbols).
*   **Unique Credentials:** Consider shipping future devices with unique, randomly generated default credentials printed on the device or its packaging.
