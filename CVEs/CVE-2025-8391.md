## Critical Stored XSS Vulnerability Discovered in Magic Edge – Lite WordPress Plugin

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in the **Magic Edge – Lite** plugin for WordPress. Such vulnerabilities pose a direct threat to business operations, potentially leading to data breaches, website defacement, reputation damage, and financial losses due to system compromise or regulatory penalties. Prompt attention to this issue is crucial for maintaining your organization's online security posture.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-8391**
*   **Affected Software:** The **Magic Edge – Lite** plugin for WordPress.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **1.1.6**.
*   **Technical Cause:** This vulnerability is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw. It stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `height` parameter within the plugin. This means that data provided for the `height` parameter by a user is not properly cleaned or secured before being stored in the database and subsequently displayed on website pages.
*   **Exploitation Mechanism:** An authenticated attacker, requiring **Contributor-level access** or higher, can inject arbitrary malicious web scripts into affected pages. These scripts are then stored in the database. Whenever a legitimate user, including administrators, accesses a page containing the injected content, the malicious script executes within their browser.
*   **Example Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `height`.

### Risk Description

Exploitation of this Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability could lead to severe consequences. An attacker could:

*   **Hijack User Sessions:** Steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts, including those of administrators.
*   **Deface Websites:** Alter the content or appearance of your website.
*   **Redirect Users:** Force users to malicious websites designed for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Inject Malware:** Load and execute malicious code in the user's browser, potentially compromising their system.
*   **Steal Data:** Collect sensitive information visible in the user's browser, such as credentials or personal data.

### Who is at Risk

Any WordPress website currently utilizing the **Magic Edge – Lite** plugin, especially those running version **1.1.6** or earlier, is at risk. Organizations that permit users with **Contributor-level access** or higher to their WordPress sites should give immediate priority to addressing this vulnerability.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** Monitor the official WordPress plugin repository for an urgent update to the **Magic Edge – Lite** plugin. Update to the patched version as soon as it becomes available.
*   **Review User Permissions:** If an immediate patch is not yet available, consider temporarily restricting or carefully reviewing permissions for all users with Contributor-level access or higher until the vulnerability is addressed.

**For Developers (of the Magic Edge – Lite plugin):**

*   **Robust Input Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive input sanitization for all user-supplied data, particularly for parameters like `height`. Ensure that all potentially malicious characters and code are properly filtered or neutralized before data is stored in the database.
*   **Thorough Output Escaping:** Apply appropriate output escaping for all data retrieved from the database before it is rendered in HTML. This is critical to prevent injected scripts from executing in the user's browser. Specifically, ensure the `height` parameter's output is always escaped using functions like `esc_attr()` or `esc_html()`.
