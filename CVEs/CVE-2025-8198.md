## Price Manipulation Vulnerability in MinimogWP WordPress Theme

E-commerce platforms rely on accurate pricing and secure transaction processing. Vulnerabilities that allow price manipulation directly threaten the financial integrity of online stores, leading to potential revenue loss and unfair transactions.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical price manipulation vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8198**, has been discovered in the **MinimogWP â€“ The High Converting eCommerce WordPress Theme**.

The vulnerability affects **all versions of MinimogWP up to and including 3.9.0**.

### Technical Cause

The root cause is an **insufficient validation of quantity values** when users modify items in their shopping cart. This flaw permits unauthenticated attackers to add products to their cart and then specify a **fractional quantity** (e.g., `0.5` instead of `1` or `2`). This fractional quantity is subsequently used in price calculations, leading to an incorrect, typically lower, total price for the items.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to purchase products at **manipulated, reduced prices**, directly impacting the store's revenue. This can lead to significant financial losses for e-commerce site owners.

### Recommendations

Site owners using the MinimogWP theme are strongly advised to take the following actions:

*   **Update the MinimogWP theme** to the latest available version as soon as a patch is released (beyond `3.9.0`).
*   Ensure that **WooCommerce version 9.8.2 or higher** is installed and active. The vendor notes that the vulnerability cannot be exploited if WooCommerce is updated to this specific version or newer.
