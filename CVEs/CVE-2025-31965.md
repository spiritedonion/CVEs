## Urgent Security Advisory: Critical Vulnerability in HCL BigFix Remote Control Server WebUI

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in the **HCL BigFix Remote Control Server WebUI**. This issue could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information, posing a direct risk to your organization's data security and operational integrity.

This advisory serves to inform both technical teams and leadership about the immediate need for action to protect your systems.

### Introduction

In today's interconnected business environment, securing remote access tools is paramount. A newly discovered flaw in **HCL BigFix Remote Control Server WebUI** could be exploited by non-administrative users to view confidential system information. Such unauthorized access can lead to data exposure, compromise operational security, and potentially violate compliance regulations. Addressing this vulnerability promptly is crucial to prevent potential financial and reputational damage.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-31965`
*   **Affected Software:** **HCL BigFix Remote Control Server WebUI**
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions `10.1.0.0248` and lower are impacted.

The technical cause of this vulnerability lies in improper access restrictions within the WebUI. Specifically, certain web pages that should only be accessible to users with administrative privileges fail to properly enforce these restrictions. This allows standard, non-administrative users to bypass intended security controls and view information they are not authorized to see.

While specific exploitation paths are not publicly detailed for this vulnerability, the core issue is a broken access control mechanism that allows elevation of information viewing capabilities.

### Risk Description

If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker (or any standard user with access to the system) could gain unauthorized insight into your **HCL BigFix Remote Control Server WebUI**. This includes the potential to view configuration details, system states, or other sensitive information typically reserved for administrators. Such details could be leveraged to:

*   **Gather intelligence** for further, more sophisticated attacks.
*   **Expose sensitive system architecture** or operational parameters.
*   **Compromise data privacy** or regulatory compliance.

While not directly leading to remote code execution or system takeover, the unauthorized disclosure of information is a critical step in many attack chains, increasing the overall risk posture of your infrastructure.

### Who is at Risk?

Any organization utilizing **HCL BigFix Remote Control Server WebUI** for remote management, and specifically running any version `10.1.0.0248` or lower, is at risk. This includes IT departments, managed service providers, and any entity relying on BigFix Remote Control for their operational needs.
