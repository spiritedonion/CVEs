## Urgent Security Alert: Critical Vulnerability in Archer Technology RSA Archer Allows Arbitrary Code Execution

A critical security vulnerability has been discovered in **Archer Technology RSA Archer**, posing a significant risk of arbitrary code execution to organizations using the affected software. This vulnerability could allow attackers to compromise user systems, leading to data breaches, malware infections, and loss of control. It is imperative that all affected organizations take immediate action.

### Vulnerability Details

This newly identified vulnerability is tracked as **CVE-2025-50572**.

*   **Affected Software:** **Archer Technology RSA Archer**
*   **Affected Version:** 6.11.00204.10014
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied data that is subsequently exported into CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. Specifically, certain crafted inputs provided by an attacker are not adequately sanitized before being written into an exported CSV. When a legitimate user opens this malicious CSV file using common spreadsheet applications (like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc), the embedded malicious code is automatically executed on their machine. This type of flaw is commonly known as a "CSV Injection" vulnerability.

*   **Example Payload:** An attacker could inject a string like the following into a vulnerable input field, which, upon CSV export and opening, could trigger command execution on the user's system:
    ```
    =cmd|' /C calc'!A0
    ```
    This specific example would launch the calculator application, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary commands. More sophisticated payloads could be used for malicious purposes.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve **arbitrary code execution** on the computer of any user who opens a maliciously crafted CSV file exported from the affected Archer system. This could lead to:

*   **System Compromise:** Attackers could install malware, ransomware, or spyware on the user's workstation.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive data accessible by the user could be exfiltrated.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Malicious code could attempt to gain higher privileges on the compromised system or network.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The attacker could use the compromised workstation as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.

### Who is at Risk?

Any organization utilizing **Archer Technology RSA Archer version 6.11.00204.10014** is at risk. Users who regularly export data from Archer and open it in spreadsheet applications are particularly vulnerable to this attack.

### Recommendations

**For Developers and IT Teams (Archer Technology):**

*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement robust validation and sanitization on all user-supplied inputs, especially those that will be exported or displayed. Do not trust user input.
*   **Output Encoding:** Crucially, when exporting data to CSV, ensure proper output encoding. Prepend a single quote (`'`) to any field that starts with a special character recognized by spreadsheet applications (such as `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `|`, etc.). This neutralizes potential formula execution.
*   **Security Patches:** Develop and release a patch to address this vulnerability immediately.

**For Archer System Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Apply Patches Immediately:** Monitor for an official security patch from Archer Technology and apply it without delay. This is the most effective long-term solution.
*   **User Awareness:** Educate your users about the risks of opening CSV files, even those seemingly from internal systems, until a patch is applied. Advise caution and consider temporary restrictions on opening CSV files from Archer exports if possible.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Ensure endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are up-to-date and actively monitoring for suspicious activity on user workstations. Implement least privilege principles for users.
