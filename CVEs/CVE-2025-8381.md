## Urgent Security Advisory: Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability in Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in the **Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System**, posing a direct risk to organizations utilizing this software. This flaw could lead to severe data breaches, unauthorized system access, and potential operational disruption. For businesses managing sensitive customer and booking information, addressing this vulnerability promptly is crucial to protect your data, reputation, and financial stability.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-8381**
*   **Affected Software:** **Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System**
*   **Affected Version:** **1.0**
*   **Vulnerability Type:** **SQL Injection**

This vulnerability is an **SQL Injection** flaw that arises from improper handling of user-supplied data. Specifically, the issue occurs within the `/add_reserve.php` file when processing the `room_id` argument. An attacker can manipulate this parameter, tricking the system into executing malicious database commands.

The attack can be initiated remotely, meaning an attacker does not need direct access to your internal network. Furthermore, a public exploit for this vulnerability has been disclosed, significantly increasing the immediate risk of exploitation.

**Example Payload/Path:**
Attackers can append malicious code to the `room_id` parameter within the URL:
`http://[your-hotel-reservation-system]/add_reserve.php?room_id=1%27+OR+1=1--`

This example demonstrates how an attacker could bypass authentication or extract information by injecting SQL commands.

### Risk Description

If successfully exploited, this **SQL Injection** vulnerability allows an attacker to:

*   **Steal Sensitive Data:** Gain unauthorized access to the system's database, including confidential customer information, booking details, payment records, and administrative credentials.
*   **Manipulate or Delete Data:** Alter existing bookings, create fraudulent reservations, or even delete critical database entries, leading to operational chaos and financial loss.
*   **Gain Full System Control:** In some scenarios, an attacker might be able to escalate their privileges and take complete control over the web server hosting the application, potentially installing malware or using it as a launchpad for further attacks.

Given the public disclosure of an exploit, the threat of this vulnerability being actively used in attacks is high.

### Who is at Risk?

Any organization or individual currently operating **Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System version 1.0** is at severe risk. This includes hotels, motels, bed & breakfasts, and other accommodation providers using this specific software for their online booking and reservation management.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**

*   **Implement Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** Immediately refactor all database queries, especially those interacting with user input, to use prepared statements or parameterized queries. This is the most effective defense against SQL injection.
*   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize all user input before it is used in database queries or displayed. This includes type checking, length limits, and rejecting suspicious characters.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account used by the application only has the minimum necessary permissions.

**For Website Owners and IT Administrators:**

*   **Urgent Update:** Check for and immediately apply any official patches or updated versions released by the developers of Campcodes Online Hotel Reservation System. As of this advisory, a patch may not be available, but continue to monitor for official updates.
*   **Isolate and Restrict Access:** If an immediate patch is not available, consider temporarily restricting external access to the `/add_reserve.php` file or implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block known SQL injection patterns for this specific endpoint.
*   **Database Auditing:** Implement or review logging and auditing of database activities to detect suspicious queries or unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Backup Data:** Ensure you have recent, verified backups of your entire system and database to facilitate recovery in case of a successful attack.
