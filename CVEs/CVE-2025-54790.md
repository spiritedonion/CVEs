## Critical Vulnerability Discovered in HumHub's Files Module (CVE-2025-54790)

A critical security flaw has been identified in the **Files** module for HumHub, a popular open-source social network solution. This vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-54790**, could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. For organizations using affected versions, this poses a significant risk of data breaches, compliance issues, and reputational damage.

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability exists in the **Files** module, specifically in versions **0.16.9 and below**. This module, often referred to as `cfiles` within the HumHub ecosystem, is designed for managing files within user profiles and spaces.

The core issue lies in the module's handling of backend SQL queries. It lacks proper validation and sanitization, making it susceptible to **Blind SQL Injection**. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into input fields. Even without receiving direct error messages or query results, an attacker can extract information from the database by observing subtle changes in application behavior or response times.

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of **CVE-2025-54790** grants an attacker the ability to perform **unauthorized data access**. This could include extracting sensitive information stored in the application's database, such as:

*   User credentials (usernames, hashed passwords)
*   Personal user data (emails, names, profiles)
*   Proprietary business information
*   Other confidential records

The **CVSS v4.0 Base Score of 9.2 (CRITICAL)** highlights the severe impact of this vulnerability. It indicates that it is easily exploitable over the network, requires no user interaction, and can be carried out without special privileges.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual using the HumHub platform with the **Files** module (**cfiles**) installed in version **0.16.9 or older** is at risk. This includes social intranets, community platforms, and collaboration tools built on HumHub that utilize this module for file management.

### Recommendations

**For HumHub Administrators and Website Owners:**

*   **Immediate Update:** The most crucial step is to **immediately update** your **Files** module to version **0.16.10 or higher**. This version contains the necessary security fixes.
*   **Regular Patching:** Establish a routine for regularly reviewing and updating all plugins, themes, and core HumHub software components.
*   **Security Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for unusual database activity or web application requests that could indicate attempted exploitation.

**For Developers (of `cfiles` or similar modules):**

*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. Never concatenate user-supplied input directly into SQL queries.
*   **Secure Error Handling:** Ensure that backend errors are handled gracefully and do not leak sensitive information that could aid an attacker.
