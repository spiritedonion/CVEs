## **CVE-2025-7738**: Client Secrets Exposed in Ansible Automation Platform

A new security vulnerability, **CVE-2025-7738**, has been identified in **Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)**. This flaw could lead to the exposure of sensitive GitHub Enterprise client secrets, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access to your source code repositories and potentially leading to broader system compromise. Understanding and addressing this vulnerability is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your development and operational environments.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-7738**
*   **Affected Software:** **Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)**
*   **Affected Versions:** Specific versions of AAP are impacted. Please refer to the official Red Hat advisory for precise version details and patching information.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the Gateway API of **Ansible Automation Platform**. When administrators or auditors access certain **GitHub Enterprise authenticator configurations**, the API inadvertently returns the associated client secret in clear text. This means that a critical credential, which should always remain encrypted or obfuscated, is exposed without protection when accessed by privileged users.

### Risk Description

While this vulnerability requires existing administrative or auditing privileges within AAP to be exploited, the clear text exposure of client secrets introduces significant downstream risks. If an administrator's workstation is compromised, or if logs and backups containing these configurations are inadvertently stored in insecure locations, the exposed GitHub Enterprise client secrets could be easily extracted.

These compromised secrets could then be used to gain unauthorized access to your GitHub Enterprise instance. An attacker might then steal sensitive source code, inject malicious code, make unauthorized changes to repositories, or use this access to further penetrate your network, potentially leading to data breaches, operational disruption, or intellectual property theft. The clear text exposure also poses a considerable compliance risk for organizations handling sensitive data.

### Who is at Risk

Organizations actively utilizing **Ansible Automation Platform** and specifically integrating it with **GitHub Enterprise authenticators** are at risk. This vulnerability particularly impacts environments where administrators or auditors frequently review or manage these authenticator settings. Any system where these exposed secrets could provide access to critical source code, deployment pipelines, or sensitive intellectual property should consider themselves highly exposed.

### Recommendations

**For Ansible Automation Platform Users and Administrators:**

1.  **Apply Vendor Patches Immediately:** This is the most critical step. Monitor Red Hat's official security advisories for **Ansible Automation Platform** and apply all recommended patches and updates as soon as they become available.
2.  **Strict Access Control:** Re-evaluate and enforce stringent access controls for users with administrative or auditing privileges within AAP, especially those who can access authenticator configurations. Implement the principle of least privilege.
3.  **Secure Workstations:** Ensure that workstations used by administrators and auditors who access AAP are highly secured, up-to-date, and protected against malware, as exposed secrets could be exfiltrated if the endpoint is compromised.
4.  **Review Configuration Management:** Implement secure practices for handling configuration backups and logs. Ensure that any stored configurations or logs that might contain these clear text secrets are adequately protected and encrypted.
5.  **Monitor Red Hat Advisories:** Stay informed about further guidance or mitigation steps from Red Hat regarding this vulnerability.
