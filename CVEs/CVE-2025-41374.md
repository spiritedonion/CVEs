## Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability Discovered in Gandia Integra Total of TESI Software

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**, a software solution widely used for various business operations. This flaw, if exploited, could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, and significant operational disruption. It is crucial for organizations utilizing this software to understand the risks and take immediate action.

### Why This Matters for Your Business

This newly discovered vulnerability presents a **high risk** to the integrity and confidentiality of your data. An attacker could potentially retrieve, modify, or delete critical business information stored in your databases. This could lead to severe consequences such as data breaches, financial losses, regulatory non-compliance, and damage to your organization's reputation.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-41374**
*   **Affected Software:** **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions from **2.1.2217.3 up to and including v4.4.2236.1** are vulnerable.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability is a **SQL Injection** flaw. This means an attacker can insert malicious code into specific input fields, tricking the software into executing unauthorized database commands. The issue specifically resides within the `idestudio` parameter.
*   **Vulnerable Path:** The vulnerability is found in the application's endpoint at `/encuestas/integraweb[_v4]/integra/html/view/hislistadoacciones.php`.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability has a **CVSS Base Score of 8.7 (HIGH)**, indicating a severe impact potential.

### Risk Description

An authenticated attacker, once logged into the system, can exploit this SQL Injection vulnerability. By manipulating the `idestudio` parameter, they can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the underlying database. This allows them to:

*   **Retrieve sensitive data:** Access and steal confidential information.
*   **Create new records:** Insert unauthorized data or user accounts.
*   **Update existing information:** Modify crucial business data.
*   **Delete database entries:** Erase critical records, potentially causing data loss and operational downtime.

The ability to directly interact with the database grants attackers extensive control over the system's data assets.

### Who Is At Risk?

Any organization or business that has deployed **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** within the version range of **2.1.2217.3 to v4.4.2236.1** is immediately at risk. This includes any system where these versions are actively used or accessible.

### Recommendations

**For Software Developers / IT Teams:**

*   **Patch Immediately:** Apply the latest security patches or updated versions released by the vendor (if available) as soon as possible.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement stringent input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially parameters used in database queries.
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to interact with databases. This inherently prevents SQL injection attacks by separating code from data.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct comprehensive security audits and penetration testing of your applications to identify and remediate similar vulnerabilities.

**For Website Owners / System Administrators:**

*   **Check Your Version:** Verify the version of **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** currently running on your systems.
*   **Update Promptly:** If your version falls within the affected range (**2.1.2217.3 to v4.4.2236.1**), plan for an urgent update to the latest secure version once released by the vendor.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Increase monitoring of application and database logs for any unusual activity, error messages, or suspicious queries.
*   **Access Restrictions:** Temporarily restrict external access to the vulnerable application if feasible, until a patch can be applied.
