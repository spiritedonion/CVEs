## Critical Security Alert: IP Restriction Bypass in HDP Server via **CVE-2025-6504**

Organizations often rely on IP-based restrictions to control access to sensitive systems and data. A newly discovered vulnerability, **CVE-2025-6504**, in **HDP Server** could allow attackers to bypass these crucial IP restrictions, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access to your systems and confidential information. This alert outlines the details and urgent actions required to protect your environment.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-6504**
*   **Affected Software:** **HDP Server** (on Linux)
*   **Affected Versions:** All **HDP Server** versions **below 4.6.2.2978**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The **HDP Server** processes the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header, which is typically used by proxies to indicate the original client's IP address. However, this header can be easily spoofed by an attacker. If an attacker includes a spoofed IP address in the `X-Forwarded-For` header that matches an IP address or range whitelisted for server access, the **HDP Server** may incorrectly grant access, bypassing its intended IP restrictions.

    An attacker could send a request with a crafted header like:
    ```
    X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.10, <attacker_actual_ip>
    ```
    If `192.168.1.10` is an IP address whitelisted by your HDP Server, the server might misinterpret the request as originating from a trusted source.

### Risk Description

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass IP-based access controls designed to protect your **HDP Server**. While valid user credentials are still required to access resources within the server, this bypass significantly lowers the security barrier. An attacker could potentially attempt to log in from any location, regardless of your network's IP whitelists. This increases the risk of successful brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or other attempts to gain unauthorized access to your **HDP Server** data. A successful exploit could lead to data theft, modification, or other forms of system compromise if user credentials are weak or compromised.

### Who is at Risk?

Any organization using **HDP Server** versions **below 4.6.2.2978** on Linux is at risk. This is particularly critical for those who rely heavily on IP whitelisting as a primary security measure for their **HDP Server** instances.

### Recommendations

To mitigate the risk posed by **CVE-2025-6504**, immediate action is required:

*   **For HDP Server Administrators:**
    *   **Urgent Patching:** Immediately upgrade your **HDP Server** instances to version **4.6.2.2978** or higher. This update contains the necessary fix for **CVE-2025-6504**.
    *   **Review Access Controls:** While patching is paramount, also review and strengthen all other authentication mechanisms. Ensure strong password policies are enforced, and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available for your **HDP Server** users.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Enhance your network security posture by ensuring proper network segmentation. Limit direct exposure of your **HDP Server** to untrusted networks where possible.
