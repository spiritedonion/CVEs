SQL Injection Vulnerability in Campcodes Courier Management System

Secure handling of user input is paramount for web applications to prevent malicious attacks that can compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. This write-up details a critical SQL Injection vulnerability identified in the Campcodes Courier Management System, highlighting the risks and recommended mitigation strategies.

### Vulnerability Details

A **SQL Injection** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8189**, has been discovered in **Campcodes Courier Management System version 1.0**.

The vulnerability specifically affects the `/edit_user.php` file, where the manipulation of the **`ID` argument** allows for arbitrary SQL commands to be executed. The attack can be initiated remotely without requiring complex conditions. The exploit for this vulnerability has been publicly disclosed, increasing the risk of active exploitation.

The vulnerability has a **CVSS 4.0 Base Score of 5.3 (Medium)**, with the following vector: `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X`. While the base score is Medium, the initial alert classified it as "Critical" due to its remote exploitability, low attack complexity, and public exploit availability.

### Technical Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `ID` parameter within the `/edit_user.php` script. When an attacker supplies a specially crafted input to the `ID` argument, the application directly incorporates this malicious string into an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization. This allows the attacker to alter the intended logic of the SQL query, leading to the execution of arbitrary database commands.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this SQL Injection vulnerability can lead to several severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal data, or system configurations.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized modification, insertion, or deletion of data within the database. This could include altering user privileges, forging records, or deleting critical system information.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers may be able to log in as legitimate users or administrators without valid credentials.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some database configurations, SQL Injection can be escalated to achieve remote code execution on the underlying server, giving attackers full control over the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** Broad impact on the system's integrity, availability, and confidentiality.

### Recommendations

For developers and site owners using Campcodes Courier Management System 1.0, immediate action is required:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially data used in database queries. Implement strict type checking and whitelist validation for expected data formats.
*   **Use Prepared Statements:** Employ **prepared statements** or parameterized queries with bound variables. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not as executable code, effectively preventing SQL Injection attacks.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the minimum necessary privileges required for its operations. This limits the scope of damage even if a successful injection occurs.
*   **Apply Patches:** Continuously monitor for and apply any security patches or updates released by the vendor. In the absence of an official patch, consider disabling or restricting access to the `/edit_user.php` functionality if it's not strictly necessary.
