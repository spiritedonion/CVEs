## Critical Security Alert: Command Execution Vulnerability in Cursor (CVE-2025-54131)

### Introduction

A new critical vulnerability has been identified in **Cursor**, an AI-powered code editor. This flaw, tracked as **CVE-2025-54131**, presents a significant risk for organizations using the software, potentially leading to unauthorized command execution and system compromise. For businesses, this translates to a severe threat of data breaches, intellectual property theft, or disruption of development workflows.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-54131**
*   **Affected Software:** **Cursor** (AI-powered code editor)
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions **below 1.3**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insufficient bypass vulnerability in Cursor's auto-run mode. Specifically, if a user has configured Cursor to use an allowlist for terminal commands (instead of the default "require approval for every call"), an attacker can bypass this allowlist. This bypass is achieved by embedding specific characters, such as a backtick (`` ` ``) or command substitution syntax like `$(cmd)`, within prompts or other input that Cursor processes. When chained with an indirect prompt injection, these specially crafted inputs can execute arbitrary commands outside the approved allowlist, without requiring user approval.
*   **Example Bypass Mechanism:**
    *   Attackers can craft inputs that include characters like ` ` ` or `$()`.
    *   These characters enable shell command execution, bypassing the intended security controls.

### Risk Description

Exploitation of **CVE-2025-54131** allows an attacker to achieve **arbitrary command execution** on the system running Cursor. This means an attacker could:

*   Run any command on the developer's machine.
*   Steal sensitive data, including source code, credentials, or personal information.
*   Install malware or ransomware.
*   Gain full control over the compromised system, potentially leading to further network compromise.

### Who is at Risk?

Any individual or organization using **Cursor** versions **below 1.3** is at risk, particularly if they have opted to use the **allowlist feature** in auto-run mode rather than the default "require approval" setting. Development teams and individuals who use Cursor for their daily coding tasks are directly exposed.

### Recommendations

**For Developers (Cursor Maintainers):**

*   Ensure that all input sanitization and validation mechanisms are robust, especially when processing prompts or data that might be interpreted as commands.
*   Implement stricter parsing for allowlists, preventing bypass techniques involving special characters or command substitution.
*   The fix in version 1.3 addresses this specific vulnerability.

**For Website Owners / System Administrators / Cursor Users:**

*   **Immediate Update:** The most critical action is to **update your Cursor installation to version 1.3 or higher immediately**. This version contains the patch that resolves **CVE-2025-54131**.
*   **Review Settings:** If you have used Cursor's auto-run feature, review your security settings. Consider reverting to the default setting of "require approval for every terminal call" if updating is not immediately possible, as this provides a higher level of protection.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Reinforce general security best practices, including regular backups, network segmentation, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
