## Urgent Security Advisory: Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability in Gandia Integra Total of TESI

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**, posing a serious risk to organizations utilizing this software. This flaw could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and critical system compromise, potentially resulting in substantial business disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-41373**
*   **Affected Software:** **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** from version 2.1.2217.3 up to and including v4.4.2236.1.
*   **Technical Cause:** This is a **SQL Injection** vulnerability. In simple terms, this means that the software incorrectly processes specific input from users. An attacker, even with low-level authentication (such as a basic user account), can insert malicious code into a data request. This code tricks the underlying database into executing commands it shouldn't, allowing the attacker to bypass normal security controls.
*   **Exploitation Path:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the `idestudio` parameter within the `/encuestas/integraweb[_v4]/integra/html/view/hislistadoacciones.php` path.
*   **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** **8.7 (HIGH)**

### Risk Description

An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain extensive control over the application's database. This includes the ability to:

*   **Retrieve sensitive data:** Access, steal, or expose confidential information stored within the database. This could include personal data, financial records, or proprietary business intelligence.
*   **Create, Update, and Delete Data:** Manipulate or destroy critical data, leading to data integrity issues, system instability, or complete data loss.
*   **System Compromise:** While primarily a database vulnerability, such access can often be leveraged to compromise the entire system running the application, potentially allowing the attacker to install malware, take control of the server, or escalate their privileges further.

This vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated, but the potential for extensive data manipulation and compromise makes it a critical concern.

### Who is at Risk?

Any organization or entity utilizing **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** software, specifically versions from 2.1.2217.3 to v4.4.2236.1, is directly at risk. This includes businesses, educational institutions, or other entities that rely on this software for managing their operations or data.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and IT Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** The most critical step is to update your **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** installation to the latest available version as soon as a patch is released by the vendor.
*   **Monitor Vendor Advisories:** Regularly check for official security advisories and patches from TESI or Gandia Integra.
*   **Security Audits:** Consider performing a comprehensive security audit of your systems, particularly those running affected software, to identify any existing compromises.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that all user accounts, especially those with access to the vulnerable application, operate with the principle of least privilege.

**For Developers (if developing custom integrations or plugins):**

*   **Input Validation:** Always implement strict input validation on all user-supplied data. Never trust user input; always sanitize and validate it before processing, especially when interacting with databases.
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Avoid concatenating user input directly into SQL queries.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling that does not reveal sensitive information to attackers.
