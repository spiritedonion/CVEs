## New Security Vulnerability Discovered in DECE Software Geodi: **CVE-2025-6060**

In today's digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity are paramount for all organizations. We are issuing an urgent alert regarding a newly identified security vulnerability in **DECE Software Geodi**. This flaw, if left unaddressed, presents a significant risk of data compromise, system manipulation, and potential reputational damage for businesses utilizing the affected software.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-6060**
*   **Affected Software:** **DECE Software Geodi**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions before **GEODI Setup 9.0.146**
*   **Technical Cause:** This vulnerability is an **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation**, commonly known as a Cross-Site Scripting (**XSS**) flaw. It means that **DECE Software Geodi** does not adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page. An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into an input field. When another user views a page containing this unvalidated input, the malicious script executes within their browser, under the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Example (Conceptual Payload):**
    Attackers might embed malicious code within fields that are later displayed, such as:
    `"><script>alert('Malicious Script Executed')</script>`
    or
    `"><img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`

### Risk Description

An successful **XSS** attack on **DECE Software Geodi** could allow an attacker to:

*   **Steal sensitive user data:** This includes session cookies, enabling them to hijack user accounts and impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Deface web pages:** Alter content displayed to users, impacting brand trust.
*   **Redirect users to malicious websites:** Leading to phishing attacks or malware downloads.
*   **Execute arbitrary code in the user's browser:** Potentially leading to further compromise of the victim's system or internal network.

For organizations, these risks translate directly into potential data breaches, loss of customer trust, regulatory non-compliance, and significant operational disruptions.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual currently using **DECE Software Geodi** is at risk if they are running a vulnerable version (i.e., any version prior to **GEODI Setup 9.0.146**). This applies to businesses leveraging Geodi for document management, information retrieval, or similar purposes.

### Recommendations

**For Developers and IT Teams:**

*   **Immediate Patching:** Prioritize updating your **DECE Software Geodi** installation to **GEODI Setup 9.0.146** or later. This is the most critical step to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Implement robust input validation routines for all user-supplied data, filtering out or rejecting malicious characters. Additionally, ensure all dynamic content displayed on web pages is properly output-encoded to prevent scripts from executing. This means converting special characters into their HTML entity equivalents before rendering them in the browser.

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Urgent Update:** Verify your current version of **DECE Software Geodi**. If it is older than **GEODI Setup 9.0.146**, update it immediately following the official documentation provided by DECE Software.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Increase vigilance on system and application logs for any unusual activity, especially related to user input or web page generation errors.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Regularly review and apply security updates for all software components within your infrastructure to maintain a strong security posture.
