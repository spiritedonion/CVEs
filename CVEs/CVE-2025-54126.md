## Urgent Security Advisory: Critical Vulnerability in WAMR `iwasm` Could Expose Your Services

We are issuing an urgent alert regarding a newly discovered vulnerability in the WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) `iwasm` component. This flaw could lead to unintended public exposure of services that were meant to be internally restricted, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise for affected deployments.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-54126**
*   **Affected Software:** **WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)**, specifically the `iwasm` executable binary.
*   **Affected Versions:** All `iwasm` versions **2.4.0 and below**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how `iwasm` handles the `--addr-pool` configuration option. This option is intended to restrict incoming connections to a specific IP address or range. However, if an administrator provides an IPv4 address *without* a corresponding subnet mask (e.g., `/24`), `iwasm` incorrectly interprets this as a directive to accept connections from *all* IP addresses (`0.0.0.0/0`). This bypasses any intended network restrictions, making the service accessible from the internet even if it was meant to be internal.
*   **Problematic Configuration Example:**
    A command like `iwasm --addr-pool 192.168.1.10` would inadvertently allow connections from any IP address globally, rather than restricting them to a specific internal network or host.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability could allow unauthenticated attackers to bypass intended IP-based access controls. This means a service or application configured with `iwasm` that was believed to be secure and restricted to an internal network could unknowingly become publicly accessible. Attackers could then gain **unauthorized access** to sensitive data, compromise the underlying system, or disrupt critical operations. The CVSS Base Score for this vulnerability is 6.9 (Medium), but the potential business impact of unauthorized access to critical services can be severe.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or developer deploying services or applications using **WAMR `iwasm`** versions **2.4.0 and below**, particularly if these deployments rely on the `--addr-pool` option for IP-based access restriction and were configured without explicitly specifying a subnet mask. This includes production environments where administrators assumed a default secure configuration when providing only an IP address.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**
*   **Patch Immediately:** Update your WAMR `iwasm` installations to version **2.4.1** or newer as soon as possible. This version includes the fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Validate Configurations:** Review any code or deployment scripts that utilize the `--addr-pool` option. Ensure that any IP addresses provided for restriction are always accompanied by a proper subnet mask (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) to correctly define the intended network range.

**For System Administrators & IT Teams:**
*   **Identify & Update:** Identify all systems and services running WAMR `iwasm`. Prioritize updating any instances running version **2.4.0 or below** to the latest secure version (**2.4.1+**).
*   **Review Network Controls:** Even after patching, verify that your network security controls (firewalls, access lists) are correctly configured to provide layered defense and restrict access to services as intended. Do not solely rely on application-level IP restrictions.
