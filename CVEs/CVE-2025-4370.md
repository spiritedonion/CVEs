## Critical Security Alert: Unauthenticated File Upload Vulnerability in Brizy Page Builder Plugin

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in the **Brizy – Page Builder plugin** for WordPress. This flaw, if left unaddressed, presents a serious risk, potentially allowing unauthorized individuals to upload malicious files to your website. This could lead to a range of devastating consequences, including data breaches, website defacement, or even complete system compromise, directly impacting your business operations and reputation.

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability, officially tracked as **CVE-2025-4370**, impacts the **Brizy – Page Builder plugin** across all versions up to, and including, **2.6.20**.

The core of the issue stems from two critical shortcomings:
1.  **Missing Authorization:** The `process_external_asset_urls` function lacks proper authorization checks, meaning it doesn't adequately verify if the user attempting to access it has the necessary permissions.
2.  **Missing Path Validation:** The `store_file` function fails to adequately validate the path where files are being stored.

This combination allows unauthenticated attackers—individuals without any legitimate user account or login credentials—to upload `.TXT` files directly onto the affected WordPress site's server.

### Risk Description

While the vulnerability currently permits the upload of only `.TXT` files, this is not a minor concern. This seemingly limited ability can serve as a dangerous entry point for attackers. Once they can upload files, they might:

*   **Gather Information:** Upload `.TXT` files containing scripts to probe your server's configuration, mapping out weaknesses for further exploitation.
*   **Bypass Security Measures:** In some web server configurations, `.TXT` files could potentially be executed if not properly restricted, or used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Act as a Staging Ground:** The ability to upload files provides a foothold on your server, making it easier for attackers to subsequently upload more dangerous malware or exploit other, potentially undiscovered, vulnerabilities to achieve full site control, steal sensitive data, or inject malicious code that impacts your visitors.

### Who is At Risk

Any WordPress website currently using the **Brizy – Page Builder plugin** in versions **2.6.20** or earlier is immediately at risk. This includes, but is not limited to, corporate websites, e-commerce stores, blogs, and any online platforms that rely on this plugin for their content management and design.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The most critical step is to update your **Brizy – Page Builder plugin** to the latest available patched version without delay. Always perform a full backup of your website before initiating any plugin or theme updates.
*   **Monitor Activity:** After updating, actively monitor your website's server logs for any unusual file uploads or suspicious access patterns that might indicate prior exploitation attempts.

**For Developers (of the plugin or those maintaining custom integrations):**

*   **Implement Robust Authorization Checks:** Ensure that all functions handling sensitive operations, particularly file uploads (e.g., `process_external_asset_urls`), rigorously enforce proper user authentication and authorization before proceeding.
*   **Strict Input and Path Validation:** Integrate comprehensive validation mechanisms for all user-supplied input, especially file names and paths. The `store_file` function, for instance, must validate not only the file type but also the target directory to prevent directory traversal attacks or the creation of files in arbitrary locations.
