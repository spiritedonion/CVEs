## Urgent Security Advisory: Critical Stored XSS Vulnerability in MetForm WordPress Plugin

Today, we're issuing an urgent advisory regarding a critical security vulnerability discovered in the **MetForm** plugin for WordPress. This flaw, tracked as **CVE-2025-5684**, poses a significant risk to websites using the plugin, potentially leading to data theft, website defacement, or complete system compromise.

For businesses, this vulnerability means a direct threat to the integrity of your online presence, user data privacy, and potentially your brand reputation. Immediate action is required to protect your assets.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-5684**
*   **Affected Software:** The **MetForm â€“ Contact Form, Survey, Quiz, & Custom Form Builder for Elementor** plugin for WordPress.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **4.0.1**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw. It originates from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping specifically within the `mf-template` DOM Element. This means that data submitted by a user is not properly cleaned before being stored in the database, nor is it adequately secured when displayed back on a webpage.
*   **Example Payload Type:** An attacker could inject arbitrary web scripts (typically malicious JavaScript code) into forms or templates handled by MetForm. When an unsuspecting user accesses a page containing this injected content, the malicious script automatically executes in their browser.

### Risk Description

This **Stored XSS** vulnerability is critical because it allows authenticated attackers with **Contributor-level access** or higher to inject malicious web scripts. Once injected, these scripts are stored on your website and will execute whenever any user (including site administrators or visitors) views the affected page.

An attacker could leverage this to:

*   **Steal Sensitive Data:** Capture user session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover of administrators or other high-privileged users.
*   **Deface Your Website:** Alter the content or appearance of web pages.
*   **Redirect Users:** Force visitors to malicious websites (e.g., phishing sites).
*   **Install Malware:** Leverage the compromised session to install malicious software or backdoors on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Execute Unauthorized Actions:** Perform actions on behalf of the victim within the WordPress dashboard without their consent.

### Who is at Risk?

Any WordPress website that uses the **MetForm** plugin, particularly those running versions **4.0.1** or earlier, is at risk. This is especially true for sites that allow users with **Contributor-level accounts** or higher to interact with MetForm functionalities (e.g., submitting forms, quizzes, or surveys).

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

1.  **Update Immediately:** Check for an updated version of the **MetForm** plugin that addresses **CVE-2025-5684**. If one is available (a version higher than 4.0.1), update your plugin *immediately*. This is the most crucial step.
2.  **Monitor for Patches:** If no patched version is currently available, monitor the official WordPress plugin repository and MetForm's release channels closely for updates.
3.  **Audit User Roles:** Review your WordPress user roles and permissions. Restrict access to `Contributor` or higher roles only to trusted individuals.
4.  **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Utilize a WAF (like Sucuri or Cloudflare) to help filter malicious requests and provide an additional layer of protection, though this may not fully mitigate stored XSS unless specifically configured.
5.  **Regular Backups:** Ensure you have recent, tested backups of your website.

**For Developers:**

1.  **Sanitize All Input:** Ensure that all user-supplied data is thoroughly sanitized *before* it is stored in the database. Use WordPress functions like `sanitize_text_field()`, `wp_kses_post()`, or similar context-specific sanitization routines.
2.  **Escape All Output:** Always escape data *immediately before* it is displayed to the user. Use functions like `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`, or `wp_kses_post()` as appropriate for the output context.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** When designing features, adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
4.  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests on your code, especially for features that handle user input and display it back.
