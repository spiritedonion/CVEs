## Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability Discovered in Gandia Integra Total of TESI

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**, posing a substantial risk to organizations utilizing the software. This flaw, a type of **SQL Injection**, could lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized data access, manipulation, and potential compromise of critical business information. Understanding and addressing this vulnerability swiftly is crucial for maintaining data integrity and operational security.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-41376**
*   **Affected Software:** **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions **2.1.2217.3** through **v4.4.2236.1** are impacted.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability is a **SQL Injection** flaw. This occurs when an application constructs database queries using user-supplied input without proper validation or sanitization. In this specific case, an **authenticated attacker** can manipulate the `'idestudio'` parameter within a particular script. This allows them to bypass the application's intended logic and execute arbitrary commands directly on the underlying database.
*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** The exploitable parameter is found within the `consultacuotasred.php` script, located at the path:
    `/encuestas/integraweb[_v4]/integra/html/view/consultacuotasred.php`
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **8.7 (HIGH)**

### Risk Description

If exploited, this SQL Injection vulnerability grants an authenticated attacker extensive control over the application's database. This could lead to several critical outcomes:

*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive or confidential data, including customer records, financial information, proprietary business data, and user credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The ability to create, update, or delete database entries means attackers could alter critical business data, delete historical records, or inject false information, leading to operational disruptions and fraudulent activities.
*   **System Compromise:** In some scenarios, successful SQL Injection can be escalated to achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to a complete system takeover.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual currently using **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** within the affected version range (**2.1.2217.3** to **v4.4.2236.1**) is immediately at risk. This specifically includes businesses that rely on this software for managing operations, customer data, or internal processes where the vulnerable component is accessible.

### Recommendations

**For System Administrators and Owners:**

*   **Immediate Update:** The most critical action is to **update Gandia Integra Total of TESI** to the latest secure version provided by the vendor. This is typically the fastest and most effective way to patch the vulnerability.
*   **Temporary Mitigations:** If immediate patching is not feasible, consider implementing the following:
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy or configure WAF rules to detect and block suspicious SQL injection attempts against the `/encuestas/integraweb[_v4]/integra/html/view/consultacuotasred.php` endpoint.
    *   **Access Restrictions:** Limit access to the vulnerable application component or enforce stricter network-level access controls where possible.
    *   **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of database logs and application logs for any unusual activity or error messages that might indicate attempted exploitation.

**For Developers (General Best Practices):**

*   **Parameterized Queries:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases. This ensures that user-supplied input is treated as data, not as executable code, fundamentally preventing SQL Injection.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied data at the application layer. Never trust user input.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that database user accounts used by the application have only the minimum necessary privileges required for their functions.
*   **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security code reviews and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.
