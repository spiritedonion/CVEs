## Urgent Security Advisory: **Polkadot Frontier** Vulnerability `CVE-2025-54429`

We are issuing an important security advisory regarding a recently discovered vulnerability in **Polkadot Frontier**, an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. This vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-54429**, has the potential to lead to unintended interactions with custom precompiled contracts, which could impact the integrity and expected behavior of your blockchain applications. Understanding and addressing this issue is critical to maintaining the security and reliability of your Frontier-based deployments.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-54429**
*   **Affected Software:** **Polkadot Frontier**
*   **Affected Versions:** All commits prior to `0822030`
*   **Fixed Version:** `0822030` and later

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect classification of account types within **Polkadot Frontier**'s EVM compatibility layer. For safety, certain EVM mechanisms, specifically precompiled contracts, are designed to be callable only by specific account types or when explicitly configured (e.g., via `CallableByContract`).

Specifically, when a smart contract creates another contract using EVM opcodes like `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, the underlying implementation of the `CallableByContract` mechanism incorrectly identified the caller's address type as an "Externally Owned Account" (**AddressType::EOA**) instead of a "Contract Account" (**AddressType::Contract**). This misidentification could bypass intended access controls for custom precompile implementations that rely on correct `AddressType` distinctions.

**Note:** This issue primarily affects users who have implemented and use *custom precompile implementations* that utilize `AddressType::EOA` and `AddressType::Contract` distinctions. It is not directly exploitable in any of the predefined precompiles within Frontier.

### Risk Description

An attacker, by deploying a malicious smart contract that utilizes the `CREATE` or `CREATE2` opcodes, could potentially interact with custom precompiled contracts in unintended ways. This could lead to:

*   **Integrity Bypass:** Circumventing designed access restrictions for custom precompiles.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Causing custom precompiles to execute functions or operations that they were not intended to perform when called by a smart contract.
*   **Service Integrity Impact:** While not leading to direct data theft or full system compromise, this could compromise the integrity of specific custom functionalities implemented using precompiles, potentially causing disruptions or incorrect state transitions on the blockchain.

The CVSS Base Score for this vulnerability is **6.9 (MEDIUM)**, indicating a moderate but significant risk, particularly for those with custom implementations.

### Who Is At Risk?

Organizations and individuals operating blockchain networks or applications built on **Polkadot Frontier** are at risk if their deployments are running versions prior to commit `0822030` AND they utilize **custom precompile implementations** that rely on specific distinctions between Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract accounts for access control.

### Recommendations

**For Developers and Blockchain Engineers:**

1.  **Immediate Update:** Upgrade your **Polkadot Frontier** dependency to commit `0822030` or the latest stable release as soon as possible. This commit contains the patch that corrects the address type misclassification.
2.  **Code Review:** Thoroughly review any custom precompile implementations within your projects. Ensure that their security and access control mechanisms are robust and do not solely rely on the `AddressType` distinction that was previously flawed, even after patching. Consider additional layers of validation if sensitive operations are performed.

**For Project Owners and Node Operators:**

1.  **Verify Version:** Confirm the version of **Polkadot Frontier** running in your infrastructure.
2.  **Plan Upgrade:** Schedule an upgrade to the patched version (`0822030` or newer) without delay. Coordinate with your development and IT teams to ensure a smooth transition.
3.  **Risk Assessment:** If you use custom precompiles, work with your technical teams to understand the specific impact this vulnerability might have had on your applications and whether any past transactions could have been affected.
