## Urgent Security Alert: Critical SQL Injection in Phpgurukul Pre-School Enrollment System

A critical security flaw has been identified in the Phpgurukul Pre-School Enrollment System that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and compromise your systems. This type of vulnerability, known as SQL Injection, poses a significant risk to data privacy, operational continuity, and your organization's reputation.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-51045**
*   **Affected Software:** **Phpgurukul Pre-School Enrollment System**
*   **Affected Version:** Version **1.0**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user input within the `username` parameter of the `/admin/password-recovery.php` file. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries directly into the database.
*   **Example Exploit:** An attacker can exploit this by inputting specially crafted strings into the `username` field during a password recovery attempt. For instance, an input like `' OR 1=1-- -` sent to `/admin/password-recovery.php` could manipulate the underlying database query.

### Risk Description

Exploitation of this **SQL Injection** vulnerability grants an attacker unauthorized access to the system's database. This could lead to:

*   **Sensitive Data Theft:** Attackers may access and exfiltrate highly confidential information, including student records, parent contact details, financial data, and administrative credentials.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers could modify database records, including user permissions, potentially granting themselves administrative control over the entire Phpgurukul Pre-School Enrollment System.
*   **Operational Disruption:** Database manipulation could lead to data corruption, service outages, or the installation of malicious software, severely disrupting operations.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or institution currently using **Phpgurukul Pre-School Enrollment System version 1.0** is at critical risk. This primarily impacts educational institutions and childcare facilities that rely on this software for managing enrollments and sensitive student information.

### Recommendations

**For Developers (Phpgurukul):**

*   **Immediate Patching:** Prioritize developing and releasing a security patch that addresses the input validation flaw in `/admin/password-recovery.php`.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. Avoid direct string concatenation in SQL queries.
*   **Robust Input Validation:** Ensure all user inputs are strictly validated, sanitized, and properly escaped before being used in database queries or displayed.

**For System Administrators & Owners:**

*   **Apply Patches Immediately:** As soon as an official security update is released by Phpgurukul, apply it without delay. This is the most effective mitigation.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Regularly review system logs for unusual access patterns, errors related to database queries, or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Isolate Affected Systems:** If patching is not immediately possible, consider isolating the system from public access or implementing strict firewall rules to limit access to the password recovery function until a patch can be applied.
*   **Backup Data:** Ensure recent and secure backups of all critical data are maintained to facilitate recovery in case of a breach.
