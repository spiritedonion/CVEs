## New Vulnerability in **HT Mega for Elementor** Plugin: Critical Data Deletion Risk

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in the **HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor** plugin for WordPress. This flaw could allow unauthorized deletion of critical website content and media, posing a serious risk to data integrity, site availability, and potentially leading to reputation damage or financial loss if not addressed promptly.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-8068**
*   **Affected Software:** **HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor** WordPress plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **2.9.1**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an "Improper Capability Check" within the plugin's `ajax_trash_templates` function. This function, intended for managing templates and related content, fails to correctly verify a user's permissions before processing requests.
*   **Example Trigger (Conceptual):** An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted AJAX request to your WordPress site that invokes the `ajax_trash_templates` function. Because the plugin does not properly check the user's capabilities, this action can be performed even by users with low-level access.

### Risk Description

Exploiting this vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker, even with a low-privilege role such as a **Contributor**, to:

*   **Delete arbitrary attachment files:** This means images, documents, and other media files uploaded to your WordPress site can be permanently removed from your server.
*   **Move arbitrary posts, pages, and templates to the Trash:** Important articles, landing pages, and website templates can be moved to the trash, making your valuable content unavailable to visitors and potentially requiring significant effort to restore.

Such actions can severely disrupt your website's operations, leading to data loss, broken site functionality, and significant administrative effort to recover.

### Who is at Risk

Any WordPress website using the **HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor** plugin, especially those running versions **2.9.1 or older**, is at risk. Sites that allow user registration or have multiple authenticated users (e.g., contributors, authors) are particularly vulnerable as these lower-privileged accounts can be leveraged for malicious activity.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** If a patched version of **HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor** is available, update your plugin immediately. Always check the official WordPress plugin repository for the latest secure versions.
*   **Regular Backups:** Ensure you have recent, tested backups of your entire WordPress site (files and database). This is your last line of defense for quick recovery in case of a successful attack.
*   **Monitor User Activity:** Be vigilant about unusual activity from authenticated users, especially those with lower-level roles.

**For Developers (of the HT Mega plugin):**

*   **Implement Robust Capability Checks:** Ensure that all AJAX endpoints and functions that perform destructive actions (like deletion, moving to trash, or content modification) thoroughly verify the user's capabilities using WordPress's built-in permission checks (e.g., `current_user_can()`) before executing the action.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users can only perform actions explicitly granted by their role.
