## Immediate Action Required: Critical Code Injection in ProcessMaker Open Source (CVE-2013-10035)

A critical software vulnerability has been identified in **ProcessMaker Open Source**, posing a significant risk of system compromise, data theft, and disruption to business operations. This flaw, tracked as **CVE-2013-10035**, could allow an attacker with even basic user credentials to gain full control over affected systems. Organizations utilizing this software must take immediate steps to assess their exposure and apply necessary mitigations.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2013-10035**
*   **Affected Software:** **ProcessMaker Open Source**
*   **Affected Versions:** This vulnerability impacts **ProcessMaker Open Source versions 2.x**, specifically including **2.0.23 through 2.5.1**.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability has a **CVSS Base Score of 8.7 (HIGH)**, indicating its severe potential impact.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a code injection flaw within the default **'neoclassic'** skin. It arises because specific application endpoints, such as `appFolderAjax.php`, `casesStartPage_Ajax.php`, and `cases_SchedulerGetPlugins.php`, fail to properly validate user-supplied input. An authenticated user can send specially crafted POST requests, manipulating parameters like `action` and `params`, to directly execute arbitrary PHP code. This is possible because the application directly invokes dangerous PHP functions, such as `system()`, with unvalidated user input.
*   **Example Paths/Parameters:** Attackers can leverage this by sending crafted POST requests to paths like `/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/appFolderAjax.php` or `/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/casesStartPage_Ajax.php`, manipulating parameters such as `action` and `params` to inject malicious PHP code.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this **critical vulnerability** allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This capability, known as Remote Code Execution (RCE), means an attacker could:

*   **Steal sensitive data:** Access and exfiltrate confidential business data, customer information, or intellectual property.
*   **Install malware:** Deploy ransomware, backdoors, or other malicious software, leading to further compromise.
*   **Take control of the system:** Fully compromise your ProcessMaker instance, deface websites, or use your server as a launchpad for further attacks within your network.

Given that only valid user credentials are required, the potential for unauthorized access and severe business disruption is extremely high.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual running **ProcessMaker Open Source versions 2.0.23 through 2.5.1** is at **immediate risk**. This includes both Linux and Windows installations where the default **'neoclassic'** skin is in use. Since the vulnerable skin cannot be removed via the web interface, virtually all installations within the specified version range are susceptible if not properly updated or mitigated.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**

*   **Implement Robust Input Validation:** Ensure all user-supplied data, especially parameters used in system calls or interpreter evaluations, undergoes rigorous validation and sanitization.
*   **Avoid Direct System Calls:** Refrain from directly invoking system commands (e.g., `system()`, `exec()`) with user-supplied input. If absolutely necessary, ensure input is meticulously whitelisted and sanitized.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Review codebases for similar patterns of insecure deserialization, code injection, and command injection vulnerabilities.

**For Website Owners and IT Administrators:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The most effective immediate action is to **update your ProcessMaker Open Source installation to the latest secure version (beyond 2.5.1)** as soon as possible. This vulnerability has been known for some time, and later versions have addressed these issues.
*   **Apply WAF Rules:** If immediate patching is not feasible, consider implementing Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block suspicious requests to the identified endpoints (`appFolderAjax.php`, `casesStartPage_Ajax.php`, `cases_SchedulerGetPlugins.php`).
*   **Network Segmentation and Access Control:** Restrict network access to your ProcessMaker instance as much as possible, ideally limiting it to trusted IP addresses only.
*   **Monitor and Audit:** Regularly audit user accounts and activity for suspicious behavior. Implement strong password policies, though this vulnerability requires only *any* valid credentials.
