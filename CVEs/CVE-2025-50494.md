**New Vulnerability Discovered in PHPGurukul Car Washing Management System**

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in the **PHPGurukul Car Washing Management System**, specifically in version **v1.0**. This flaw could allow attackers to hijack user sessions, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and significant operational disruption. It's crucial for organizations using this system to understand the risks and take immediate action to protect their operations and customer data.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-50494**
*   **Affected Software:** **PHPGurukul Car Washing Management System**
*   **Affected Version:** **v1.0**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper session invalidation within the system's password change functionality. When a user changes their password via the `/doctor/change-password.php` component, their old session token is not properly invalidated. This means if an attacker somehow gained access to a user's session token *before* a password change, they could continue to use that session to impersonate the legitimate user, even after the password has been updated.
*   **Affected Component Path:** `/doctor/change-password.php`

### Risk Description

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could perform a **session hijacking** attack. This allows them to effectively take over a legitimate user's active session. Once a session is hijacked, the attacker can access the system with the privileges of the compromised user, potentially leading to:

*   Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   Modification or deletion of critical data.
*   Execution of unauthorized actions within the system.
*   Complete system compromise, depending on the hijacked user's privileges.

### Who is at Risk

Organizations and businesses currently using **PHPGurukul Car Washing Management System v1.0** are directly at risk. This includes any entity that has deployed this specific version of the software for managing their car washing operations.

### Recommendations

**For Developers (PHPGurukul):**

*   **Implement Proper Session Invalidation:** Ensure that all previous user sessions are immediately and irrevocably invalidated whenever a user performs a sensitive action, such as changing their password, logging out, or if suspicious activity is detected. A new, unique session token should be issued for any new authenticated session.

**For System Administrators and Users:**

*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Keep a close watch on system logs for any unusual login attempts or unauthorized actions, particularly around the time of password changes.
*   **Force Re-authentication:** As a temporary measure, consider implementing a policy that forces all users to log out and then log back in immediately after changing their password.
*   **Contact the Vendor:** Reach out to PHPGurukul directly for an official security patch or upgrade instructions for this vulnerability. Applying an official fix is the most effective way to mitigate this risk.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your applications and infrastructure to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
