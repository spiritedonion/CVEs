### SQL Injection Vulnerability in Campcodes Courier Management System

SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities are among the most critical security flaws, allowing attackers to interfere with an application's database queries. Such vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete compromise of the underlying database and potentially the server.

### Vulnerability Details

A **critical SQL Injection vulnerability**, identified as **CVE-2025-8188**, has been discovered in **Campcodes Courier Management System version 1.0**.

This flaw resides within the `/edit_staff.php` file, where the application fails to properly sanitize or validate input provided via the **`ID` argument**. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application.

The vulnerability can be exploited **remotely** and requires **low privileges** (e.g., an authenticated user account). A public exploit proof-of-concept exists, increasing the urgency for remediation.

The CVSS 4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is `5.3` (Medium), with the vector `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this SQL Injection vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, courier details, financial records, or other confidential operational data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of existing records within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If administrative credentials or hashes are stored in the database, an attacker could potentially gain higher privileges within the system.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some database configurations and application setups, SQL Injection can be escalated to achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to full system compromise.

### Recommendations

For developers and site owners using Campcodes Courier Management System version 1.0, immediate action is required:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** All user-supplied input, especially parameters like `ID` in `/edit_staff.php`, must be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent malicious characters from being included in SQL queries.
*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not as executable code, effectively preventing SQL Injection attacks.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that database user accounts have only the minimum necessary permissions required for their operations.
*   **Security Updates:** Monitor for official patches or updates from Campcodes and apply them immediately once available.
