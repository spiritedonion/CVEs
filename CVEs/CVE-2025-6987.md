## Stored XSS Vulnerability in Advanced iFrame WordPress Plugin

WordPress plugin vulnerabilities can significantly impact website security, leading to data breaches, site defacement, or further compromise. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a particularly potent threat, as it allows attackers to embed malicious scripts directly into a website, which then execute for any user viewing the compromised content.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability has been identified in the **Advanced iFrame** plugin for **WordPress**.

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-6987`
*   **Affected Software:** Advanced iFrame plugin for WordPress
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to, and including, **2025.5**.
*   **CVSS Score:** Not yet assigned (N/A)

This vulnerability arises from **insufficient input sanitization** and **output escaping** of user-supplied attributes processed by the plugin's `advanced_iframe` shortcode. An **authenticated attacker** with **contributor-level access** or higher can exploit this by injecting arbitrary web scripts into pages or posts.

### Potential Risks

When a legitimate user accesses an injected page, the malicious web scripts automatically execute within their browser context. This can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Session hijacking**: Allowing attackers to impersonate logged-in users, including administrators.
*   Website **defacement**: Modifying the appearance or content of the compromised pages.
*   Redirection to malicious sites: Leading users to phishing pages or sites distributing malware.
*   **Disclosure of sensitive information**: Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other user data.
*   **Privilege escalation** or **remote code execution**: In an administrative context, such an XSS could facilitate further compromise if combined with other vulnerabilities.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**
Ensure all user-supplied input, particularly within shortcode attributes, undergoes stringent **input sanitization** and **output escaping**. Adopt a **whitelist approach** for allowed attributes and their values to prevent the injection of malicious code.

**For Site Owners:**
It is **critically important** to update the **Advanced iFrame** plugin to the patched version as soon as it becomes available. Until a fix is released, consider implementing additional security measures, such as restricting user roles to prevent contributors or authors from creating or editing content that could embed the `advanced_iframe` shortcode. Regularly audit site content for any unusual or suspicious shortcode usage.
