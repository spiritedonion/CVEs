## Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability Found in Gandia Integra Total of TESI

### Introduction

A significant security flaw has been identified in **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**, a software widely used for managing surveys and data. This vulnerability, a type of **SQL Injection**, could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, and disruption of operations. For organizations relying on this software, addressing this issue immediately is crucial to protect against data breaches, maintain system integrity, and avoid potential financial and reputational damage.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-41372**
*   **Affected Software:** **Gandia Integra Total of TESI**
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions **2.1.2217.3** through **v4.4.2236.1** are vulnerable.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input. Specifically, the software fails to adequately sanitize or validate data passed through the `'idestudio'` parameter. This allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious database commands directly into the application's queries.
*   **Exploitable Path:** The vulnerability exists within the application's handling of requests to:
    `/encuestas/integraweb[_v4]/integra/html/view/informe_campo_entrevistas.php`

### Risk Description

If exploited, this **SQL Injection** vulnerability grants an authenticated attacker extensive control over your database. This means an attacker could:

*   **Retrieve sensitive data:** Access, steal, or exfiltrate any information stored in the database, including confidential business data, customer records, or internal reports.
*   **Create or modify data:** Insert new records, alter existing information, or manipulate system configurations, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes.
*   **Delete data:** Erase critical databases or specific records, causing significant data loss and operational disruption.
*   **Achieve full system compromise:** In some cases, SQL Injection can be escalated to gain remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to install malware, establish persistent backdoors, or take full control of the underlying system.

The CVSS 4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is **8.7 (HIGH)**, reflecting its severe potential impact.

### Who is at Risk

Organizations utilizing **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** within the affected version range (from **2.1.2217.3** to **v4.4.2236.1**) are directly exposed. This includes any business, educational institution, or public sector entity that relies on this software for data management, surveys, or related operations.

### Recommendations

**For Software Developers (of Gandia Integra Total of TESI):**

*   **Patch Immediately:** Prioritize releasing and distributing an urgent security patch that addresses this SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Implement Input Validation:** Ensure all user-supplied input, especially in parameters like `'idestudio'`, is rigorously validated and sanitized before being used in database queries.
*   **Use Parameterized Queries:** Adopt parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL Injection by separating code from data.

**For Website Owners and IT Administrators (using Gandia Integra Total of TESI):**

*   **Check Your Version:** Immediately identify the version of **Gandia Integra Total of TESI** you are running.
*   **Apply Patches:** As soon as an official patch is released by the vendor, apply it without delay. This is the most effective mitigation.
*   **Temporary Mitigation (If no patch is available):**
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement or update WAF rules to detect and block SQL Injection attempts targeting the identified path and parameter.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account connected to the application has only the absolute minimum privileges required for its operations. This limits potential damage if an injection occurs.
    *   **Monitor Logs:** Increase vigilance on application and database logs for unusual activity, error messages, or suspicious query patterns.
