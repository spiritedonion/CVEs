## Security Alert: New **Username Enumeration** Vulnerability in **OPEXUS FOIAXpress PAL**

**Immediate action is advised for organizations utilizing OPEXUS FOIAXpress Public Access Link (PAL). A newly discovered vulnerability could expose your system to account compromise, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or system breaches.**

This vulnerability, while seemingly minor, provides a critical stepping stone for malicious actors. By identifying valid user accounts, attackers can significantly streamline their efforts in launching more damaging attacks, such as brute-force password guessing or highly targeted phishing campaigns. This increases the risk of financial loss, data exfiltration, or disruption to operations.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-54834**
*   **Affected Software:** **OPEXUS FOIAXpress Public Access Link (PAL)**
*   **Affected Version:** `v11.1.0`
*   **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** `6.9`

The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `/App/CreateRequest.aspx` endpoint within the Public Access Link component. An unauthenticated attacker can repeatedly query this specific web address to determine if a username exists on the system. Crucially, there are no security controls, such as rate-limiting, to prevent an attacker from making an unlimited number of these checks.

This lack of rate-limiting allows an attacker to programmatically test a large list of potential usernames very quickly, confirming which ones are valid accounts within your FOIAXpress system.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker to compile an extensive list of valid usernames present in your **OPEXUS FOIAXpress PAL** system. This validated list of accounts then becomes a valuable resource for follow-on attacks:

*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can use the enumerated usernames to launch focused brute-force password attacks, greatly increasing their chances of guessing correct credentials and gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Targeted Phishing:** Knowing which usernames are valid allows attackers to craft highly convincing and personalized phishing emails. These scams can trick users into revealing passwords or clicking malicious links, leading to system compromise or malware installation.
*   **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation of these subsequent attacks could result in full account takeover, allowing attackers to view sensitive FOIA requests, manipulate data, or gain further access to your network.

### Who is At Risk

Any organization currently running **OPEXUS FOIAXpress Public Access Link (PAL)** version `v11.1.0` is immediately at risk. This includes government agencies, legal firms, or any entity using the software to manage public information requests.

### Recommendations

**For System Administrators and IT Teams:**

1.  **Immediate Update:** The most critical step is to update your **OPEXUS FOIAXpress Public Access Link (PAL)** installation to the latest available version as soon as possible. Updates typically include patches for known vulnerabilities.
2.  **Monitor Logs:** Closely monitor your system logs for unusual login attempts, repeated requests to the `/App/CreateRequest.aspx` endpoint from suspicious IP addresses, or failed login attempts against a large number of distinct usernames.
3.  **Strong Authentication:** Reinforce strong password policies across your organization. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access even if they obtain a valid username and password.

**For Developers (General Guidance):**

While this is a vendor-specific vulnerability, the underlying cause highlights critical best practices:

*   **Implement Rate-Limiting:** Always include robust rate-limiting mechanisms on all authentication-related endpoints and any public-facing APIs. This prevents automated abuse like username enumeration or brute-force attacks.
*   **Generic Error Messages:** Avoid providing specific feedback about whether a username or password is correct during login attempts. Instead, use generic messages like "Invalid credentials" to prevent enumeration.
