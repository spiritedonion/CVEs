## Critical Vulnerability Discovered in GLPI: Update Your Systems Immediately

A new **critical vulnerability**, identified as **CVE-2025-53113**, has been discovered in **GLPI** (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique), a widely used IT asset and service management software. This flaw poses a significant risk of unauthorized access to sensitive IT asset information, potentially leading to data exposure, compliance issues, and operational disruptions for affected organizations. Addressing this vulnerability is crucial for maintaining data integrity and overall IT security.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-53113`
*   **Affected Software:** **GLPI** (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique)
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions from 0.65 up to and including **10.0.18**.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper authorization bypass within **GLPI**'s "external links" feature. A user with technician privileges can exploit this feature to craft requests that fetch and display information on items or assets they are not authorized to view, effectively bypassing standard access controls. While no specific malicious payload path is publicly available, the exploitation method involves manipulating parameters within the external links functionality to reference internal data that should be restricted.

### Risk Description

Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized information disclosure. An attacker with technician-level access could potentially gather sensitive data about an organization's IT infrastructure, including details about assets, configurations, or user information, which they are not permitted to see. This unauthorized access to critical operational data can undermine an organization's security posture, lead to compliance breaches, and potentially be leveraged for further, more severe attacks.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual using **GLPI** for IT asset management, service desk operations, or software auditing, where the software version falls within the affected range (**0.65 through 10.0.18**), is at immediate risk. This impacts a wide array of businesses and public sector entities relying on **GLPI** for their IT operations.

### Recommendations

*   **For GLPI Administrators and IT Teams:**
    *   **Immediate Update:** The most critical step is to update your **GLPI** installation to version **10.0.19** or higher as soon as possible. This version contains the patch that fully addresses the vulnerability.
    *   **Review User Permissions:** While updating, review existing user permissions, especially for technician roles, to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Monitor Logs:** Increase vigilance in monitoring **GLPI** access logs for any unusual activity or attempts to access unauthorized resources, particularly involving the "external links" feature.
