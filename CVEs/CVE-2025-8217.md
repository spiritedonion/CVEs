## Action Required: Vulnerability in Amazon Q Developer VS Code Extension (**CVE-2025-8217**)

In today's interconnected digital landscape, software vulnerabilities pose significant risks, from data breaches to system downtime. We're alerting our community to a newly discovered issue in the **Amazon Q Developer Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension** that, while currently limited in its direct impact, presents a critical integrity concern for development environments. This bulletin outlines the issue and crucial steps to protect your teams and projects.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-8217**
*   **Affected Software:** **Amazon Q Developer Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension**
*   **Affected Version:** Version **1.84.0**
*   **Severity:** Medium (CVSS 4.0 Base Score: 5.1)
*   **Published:** July 30, 2025

The vulnerability stems from the presence of `inert, injected code` within the affected extension version. While this code is designed to interact with the Q Developer CLI and executes upon extension launch within VS Code, a `syntax error` currently prevents it from successfully completing its intended API calls. Despite the current inert state, the fact that unauthorized code executes poses an integrity risk within the development environment.

### Risk Description

Although the current vulnerability does not lead to immediate data theft or full system compromise due to a syntax error, its presence and execution represent an **integrity risk** within the development environment. The `injected code` executes when the extension is launched, meaning unauthorized or unexpected code is running within the VS Code environment. If the `syntax error` were to be corrected, or if this vulnerability were combined with other weaknesses, it could potentially be exploited to **execute arbitrary commands** or **manipulate developer tooling**, leading to further compromise of project code, credentials, or development systems. This introduces an unacceptable level of uncertainty and potential for future exploitation.

### Who is At Risk

Any organization or individual using the **Amazon Q Developer Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension** version **1.84.0** is at risk. This primarily impacts development teams and software engineers leveraging this specific extension in their Visual Studio Code environments.

### Recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability and secure your development environment:

*   **Immediate Update:** All users of the **Amazon Q Developer Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension** are strongly advised to upgrade to version **1.85.0** or later immediately. This new version addresses and resolves the vulnerability.
*   **Remove Affected Versions:** Ensure that any installations of version **1.84.0** are completely removed from all developer workstations and environments.
*   **Verify Installation:** After updating, verify that the correct, patched version is installed and actively in use.
