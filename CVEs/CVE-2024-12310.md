## Imprivata Enterprise Access Management Login Bypass (CVE-2024-12310)

Access management systems are a critical component of enterprise security, designed to control and authenticate user access to sensitive resources. A vulnerability that allows bypassing the login screen on shared workstations represents a severe security risk, potentially leading to unauthorized system access and compromise of data. This write-up details a critical vulnerability identified in Imprivata Enterprise Access Management.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2024-12310`
*   **Affected Software and Versions:** This vulnerability affects **Imprivata Enterprise Access Management**, which was formerly known as Imprivata OneSign. The issue is present in versions ranging from **5.3 through 24.2**.

*   **Potential Risks:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to **unauthorized access** to the host Windows system. The potential consequences are severe and include **data exposure**, **privilege escalation**, **system compromise**, and **disruption of services**. As an enterprise access management system, a bypass could impact numerous critical systems and sensitive organizational data. The CVSS 4.0 score of 7 (High) indicates significant impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Recommendations

*   **Apply Updates:** Administrators utilizing Imprivata Enterprise Access Management should closely monitor for and immediately apply security patches and updates released by Imprivata to address `CVE-2024-12310`.
*   **Review Kiosk Configurations:** Assess the security posture of all shared kiosk workstations where Imprivata is deployed. Ensure that all security best practices for public or shared systems are rigorously followed.
*   **Layered Security:** Implement additional security measures, such as physical access controls for kiosk workstations, to minimize unauthorized direct interaction with the hardware.
*   **Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and continuous monitoring of system logs for any unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts on Imprivata-managed workstations.
