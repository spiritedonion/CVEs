## New Vulnerability Discovered in **IDonate** WordPress Plugin: Data Exposure Risk

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the **IDonate – Blood Donation, Request And Donor Management System** plugin for WordPress. This flaw could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user and administrator data, posing a significant risk of privacy breaches, compliance issues, and reputational damage for organizations using the plugin.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-4523**
*   **Affected Software:** **IDonate – Blood Donation, Request And Donor Management System** WordPress plugin.
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions `2.0.0` through `2.1.9`.
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a **missing capability check** within the `admin_donor_profile_view()` function. This oversight allows authenticated users, even those with low-privilege roles like `Subscriber`, to access information that should only be available to administrators.
*   **Exploitation Example:** An attacker could craft a request that directly calls the vulnerable function without proper privilege verification. While a specific payload is not provided, the exploitation typically involves a logged-in user making a request to an administrative endpoint that triggers `admin_donor_profile_view()`, such as:
    ```
    /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=admin_donor_profile_view&donor_id=[ID]
    ```
    This allows them to bypass intended access controls.

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables an attacker to expose sensitive information, including an administrator’s username and email address. More critically, it allows unauthorized access to **all donor fields**, which may contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data related to blood donors. This unauthorized data exposure can lead to severe privacy violations, potential legal liabilities, and a significant erosion of trust with donors and users.

### Who is at Risk

Any WordPress website currently using the **IDonate – Blood Donation, Request And Donor Management System** plugin in versions `2.0.0` up to and including `2.1.9` is vulnerable. This specifically impacts organizations, charities, or blood banks that rely on this plugin for donor management and blood donation requests.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners/Administrators:**

*   **Update Immediately:** The most crucial step is to update your **IDonate** plugin to the latest secure version as soon as one becomes available. Always back up your site before performing any plugin updates.
*   **Monitor Activity:** Review your website logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized data access, particularly related to the `admin_donor_profile_view` function or unusual administrative user behavior.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure all user accounts on your WordPress site only have the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles.

**For Developers (of the IDonate plugin):**

*   **Implement Capability Checks:** Ensure that functions like `admin_donor_profile_view()` are properly secured with robust capability checks (e.g., `current_user_can('manage_options')` or similar specific capabilities) to restrict access only to authorized users.
*   **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent other potential vulnerabilities.
