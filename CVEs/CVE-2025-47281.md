## Denial of Service Vulnerability in Kyverno Policy Engine

Vulnerabilities in policy engines like Kyverno can critically impact the security posture and operational stability of cloud-native environments. A **Denial of Service (DoS)** flaw in such a core component can disrupt policy enforcement, block new deployments, or lead to a complete breakdown of cluster governance.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical **Denial of Service** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-47281**, has been discovered in **Kyverno**, a policy engine designed for cloud-native platforms.

**Affected Software and Versions:**
This vulnerability affects **Kyverno** versions **1.14.1 and below**. The issue has been resolved in version **1.14.2**.

**Technical Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of **JMESPath** variable substitutions within Kyverno policies. An attacker with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft malicious expressions. By combining the `{{@}}` variable with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function, such as:

```
{{@ | non_existent_function }}
```

This crafted expression causes a `nil` value to be substituted into the policy structure. Subsequently, internal functions, specifically `getValueAsStringMap`, expect string values. When encountering the `nil` value, these functions suffer a type assertion failure (`interface {} is nil, not string`), leading to a **panic**.

**Potential Risks:**
The successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a **Denial of Service**. This causes the Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller to crash. Furthermore, the reports controller pod experiences continuous crashes, severely impacting Kyverno's ability to enforce policies and report on compliance, leading to operational instability within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Recommendations

**For Developers and Site Owners:**

*   **Upgrade Immediately:** It is highly recommended to upgrade all Kyverno deployments to **version 1.14.2** or higher to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Review Permissions:** Regularly review and restrict permissions for creating or updating Kyverno policies to only trusted and authorized personnel. This minimizes the attack surface for such vulnerabilities.
