### Kyverno Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2025-47281)

A critical denial of service vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-47281**, has been discovered in Kyverno, a policy engine vital for cloud-native security and governance. This flaw can significantly disrupt operations by crashing core components, underscoring the importance of immediate attention for affected deployments.

This vulnerability affects **Kyverno versions 1.14.1 and below**. It allows an attacker with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies to induce a **Denial of Service (DoS)** condition.

The flaw stems from **improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions** within Kyverno policies. An attacker can craft a malicious expression by using the `{{@}}` variable combined with a pipe (`|`) and an **invalid JMESPath function**. An example payload would be `{{@ | non_existent_function }}`.

This crafted expression causes a **nil value** to be substituted into the policy structure. Subsequently, internal Kyverno functions, specifically `getValueAsStringMap`, expect string values but receive this `nil` value. This mismatch leads to a **type assertion failure** (`interface {} is nil, not string`), triggering a **panic**.

The panic results in the **crashing of Kyverno worker threads** within the admission controller, preventing new resource admissions and policy evaluations. Furthermore, the **reports controller pod experiences continuous crashes**, disrupting visibility and reporting functionalities. The overall impact is a severe **Denial of Service (DoS)**, impairing Kyverno's ability to enforce policies and manage cloud-native resources.

### Recommendations:

*   **Upgrade Kyverno immediately** to version **1.14.2** or higher, as this version contains the fix for the vulnerability.
*   Restrict permissions to create or update Kyverno policies to only trusted and authorized users.
*   Regularly review and validate Kyverno policies to prevent the introduction of malformed or malicious expressions.
