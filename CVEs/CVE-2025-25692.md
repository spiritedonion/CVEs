Protecting your customers and your business requires immediate attention to this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-25692**
*   **Affected Software:** **PrestaShop**
*   **Affected Version:** Specifically **v8.2.0**
*   **Technical Cause:** This flaw is a **PHAR deserialization vulnerability** found within the `_getHeaders` function of the **PrestaShop** application. In simple terms, this means an attacker can manipulate how the software processes certain file types or data streams. By sending a specially crafted request, they can trick the system into executing malicious code.
*   **Exploitation Method:** The vulnerability is triggered via a **crafted POST request** targeting the `_getHeaders` function. An example of a vulnerable function path could involve how the application handles file uploads or external data parsing.

### Risk Description

An attacker successfully exploiting this vulnerability could achieve **arbitrary code execution** on the affected server. This grants them full control over your **PrestaShop** instance. The consequences are severe and include:

*   **Data Theft:** Compromise of sensitive customer information, including personal details, order history, and potentially payment card data.
*   **System Takeover:** Installation of malware, web shells, or backdoors, leading to persistent access and complete control of your server.
*   **Financial Fraud:** Manipulation of orders, transactions, or redirection of payments.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Defacement of your website, disruption of services, or loss of customer trust.

The potential for significant financial loss and legal liabilities is extremely high.
