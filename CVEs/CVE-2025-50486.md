## Critical Session Hijacking Vulnerability Discovered in PHPGurukul Car Rental Project

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in the **PHPGurukul Car Rental Project** that could expose sensitive user data and lead to unauthorized access. This flaw, tracked as **CVE-2025-50486**, presents a substantial risk of session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and potentially compromise their accounts.

For any organization utilizing this software, understanding and addressing this vulnerability is crucial to protect customer trust, prevent data breaches, and maintain system integrity.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-50486**
*   **Affected Software:** PHPGurukul Car Rental Project
*   **Affected Version:** v3.0
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper session invalidation within the `/carrental/update-password.php` component. When a user changes their password, the system fails to adequately terminate or "invalidate" their old login session. This oversight leaves the previous session active and vulnerable.
*   **Affected Component Path:** `/carrental/update-password.php`

### Risk Description

An attacker who manages to obtain an active user's session token (e.g., through network sniffing, cross-site scripting, or other means) can exploit this flaw. Even if the legitimate user subsequently changes their password, the attacker's stolen session remains valid. This means the attacker can continue to access the user's account, impersonate them, view sensitive information, modify data, or perform actions as if they were the legitimate user, without needing the new password. This can lead to unauthorized transactions, data theft, or complete account compromise.

### Who is at Risk

Any website or application deploying **PHPGurukul Car Rental Project version 3.0** is immediately at risk. This includes businesses offering car rental services, fleet management, or any platform built upon this specific software version.

### Recommendations

**For Developers:**

*   **Implement Robust Session Management:** Ensure that critical security actions, such as password changes, logout events, and account deactivation, explicitly invalidate all associated active sessions. This typically involves regenerating session IDs or marking old session tokens as expired on the server side.
*   **Review Codebase:** Thoroughly audit the session management logic, particularly in authentication and password reset workflows, to prevent similar "improper session invalidation" vulnerabilities.

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Verify Software Version:** Immediately check if your installation of **PHPGurukul Car Rental Project** is version 3.0.
*   **Seek Patches:** Monitor for an official security patch or updated version from PHPGurukul. Apply any available updates as soon as they are released. This is the most effective long-term solution.
*   **Temporary Mitigations:** If an immediate patch is not available, consider implementing a mechanism that forces all users to re-authenticate after a password change, and upon logout, ensuring server-side session termination.
