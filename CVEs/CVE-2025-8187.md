## SQL Injection Vulnerability in Campcodes Courier Management System

Vulnerabilities like SQL injection pose a significant threat to web applications, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or even complete system compromise. Addressing such flaws is critical for maintaining data integrity and user trust.

A **critical** SQL Injection vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8187**, has been discovered in **Campcodes Courier Management System** version **1.0**.

The vulnerability resides within the `edit_parcel.php` file. It specifically affects an unknown functionality where the **ID** argument is processed without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

The technical cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input in the `ID` parameter. When an unvalidated **ID** is used directly in a database query, an attacker can append arbitrary SQL commands, which the database then executes.

This flaw is **remotely exploitable**, meaning an attacker does not need local access to the system. Given that the exploit has been publicly disclosed, the system is at immediate risk.

Potential risks include:
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, parcel details, or other critical business data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of existing data, leading to system disruption or data corruption.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some configurations, particularly if the database user has elevated privileges, SQL injection can be escalated to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.

The CVSS 4.0 Base Score for this vulnerability is `5.3` (Medium), though the description rates it as critical, indicating a high impact given its easy exploitability and potential consequences.

### Recommendations for Developers and Site Owners

To mitigate this vulnerability and prevent similar issues:
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially data used in database queries.
*   **Prepared Statements:** Utilize **prepared statements** or **parameterized queries** for all database interactions. This separates the SQL code from user-supplied data, preventing SQL injection attacks.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the minimum necessary privileges required for its operations.
*   **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing of the application to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
