## SQL Injection Vulnerability in Campcodes Courier Management System

SQL Injection vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to web applications, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or even complete system compromise. Understanding and mitigating such flaws is crucial for maintaining data integrity and user trust.

### Vulnerability Details

A critical **SQL Injection** vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-8187**, has been discovered in **Campcodes Courier Management System version 1.0**.

The flaw resides in the `/edit_parcel.php` file, specifically through the manipulation of the **`ID`** argument. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter, causing the application to execute arbitrary database queries.

The vulnerability has a **CVSS 4.0 Base Score of 5.3 (Medium)**, with the vector `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X`. The attack can be launched remotely, and a public exploit has been disclosed, increasing the immediate risk.

### Potential Risks

Successful exploitation of this SQL Injection vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as customer details, parcel tracking data, or administrative credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Ability to modify, delete, or corrupt existing data within the database.
*   **System Compromise:** In certain configurations, SQL Injection can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server, potentially leading to **remote code execution (RCE)**.

### Recommendations

For developers and site owners using Campcodes Courier Management System 1.0, the following actions are strongly recommended:

*   **Apply Patches:** Immediately apply any official security patches or updates released by the vendor for Campcodes Courier Management System 1.0.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement **strict input validation** for all user-supplied data, especially for parameters like **`ID`** that are used in database queries. Ensure that input conforms to expected data types and formats.
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Utilize **prepared statements** or **parameterized queries** for all database interactions. This ensures that user input is treated as data values rather than executable SQL code, effectively preventing SQL Injection attacks.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure database users with the minimum necessary permissions to perform their functions, limiting the potential damage in case of a breach.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block common web attack vectors, including known SQL Injection patterns.
