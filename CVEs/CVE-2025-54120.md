## PCL Community Edition Vulnerability: Local Log File Credential Exposure

Credential leakage can lead to severe security breaches, compromising user accounts and sensitive data across various platforms. A critical vulnerability has been identified in **PCL (Plain Craft Launcher) Community Edition**, a popular Minecraft launcher, that could expose user login credentials for third-party services.

### Vulnerability Details

This issue is identified by **CVE-2025-54120**.

The vulnerability affects **PCL Community Edition** versions **2.12.0-beta.5** through **2.12.0-beta.9**.

The technical cause lies in insecure logging practices. During the **third-party login process**, the application inadvertently records the user's sensitive login credentials directly into a local log file. While these log files are not automatically uploaded or shared by the application, their presence on the local system creates a significant risk.

The CVSS 4.0 vector for this vulnerability is `CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X`, with a **CRITICAL** base score of **9.3**.

### Potential Risks

The primary risk is the **exposure of user login credentials**. If a user manually shares or inadvertently transmits the log file (e.g., for debugging purposes, support requests, or if their system is compromised by malware), an attacker could gain access to their third-party accounts. This could lead to:

*   **Account Compromise:** Unauthorized access to user accounts associated with the leaked credentials.
*   **Data Theft:** Further access to personal information or data linked to the compromised accounts.
*   **Wider System Compromise:** If credentials are reused across multiple services, other accounts could be at risk.

### Recommendations

**For Users and Site Owners:**

*   **Update Immediately:** Users of PCL Community Edition should update their software to version **2.12.0-beta.10** or later without delay. This version contains the fix for the vulnerability.
*   **Review Log Files:** Users who have used affected versions should consider deleting old log files to remove any lingering credentials.
*   **Change Passwords:** As a precautionary measure, users who logged into third-party services via affected PCL CE versions should change the passwords for those services.
*   **Avoid Sharing Logs:** Advise users to exercise extreme caution when sharing application log files and to only do so with trusted and verified support channels.

**For Developers:**

*   **Implement Secure Logging:** Ensure that sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, or personal identifiable information (PII), is **never written to log files** in plaintext.
*   **Redaction/Encryption:** If logging sensitive data is absolutely necessary for debugging, ensure it is properly redacted, encrypted, or hashed before being written to logs.
*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of logging configurations and practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
