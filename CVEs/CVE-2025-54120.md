### Sensitive Data Logging Vulnerability in PCL Community Edition

Accidental logging of sensitive information, particularly user credentials, poses a significant security risk. Even if stored locally, such logs can lead to severe data exposure and unauthorized access if inadvertently shared or compromised. This issue highlights the importance of rigorous secure coding practices, especially concerning user authentication flows.

**Vulnerability Details**

A critical vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-54120**, has been identified in the PCL (Plain Craft Launcher) Community Edition. This flaw affects PCL CE versions from `2.12.0-beta.5` up to, and including, `2.12.0-beta.9`.

The technical cause of this vulnerability is the **unintentional logging of login credentials** during the third-party login process. These sensitive details are written to a **local log file** on the user's system. While the log file itself is not automatically uploaded or shared by the application, its existence on the local machine presents a risk.

**Potential Risks**

The primary risk associated with this vulnerability is the **leakage of sensitive login credentials**. Although the logs are local, a user might manually send these log filesâ€”for example, when providing diagnostic information for support purposes or debugging. If shared, the exposed credentials could lead to **unauthorized access** to the user's Minecraft account or any associated third-party services.

The vulnerability has a **CVSSv4 Base Score of 9.3 (Critical)**, indicating a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (VC:H, VI:H, VA:H, SC:H, SI:H, SA:H) if exploited.

**Recommendations**

*   **For Developers:** It is crucial to implement **secure logging practices**. Sensitive information, especially authentication credentials, should never be written to log files, even locally, in plain text or any retrievable format. Review all logging mechanisms to ensure compliance with data protection principles.
*   **For Users/Site Owners:** Immediately update PCL Community Edition to **version `2.12.0-beta.10`** or later. This version contains the fix for this vulnerability. Users should also exercise extreme caution when sharing any log files from their system, as they may inadvertently contain sensitive data.
