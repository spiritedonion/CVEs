### PCL Community Edition: Local Credential Logging Vulnerability

The unintended logging of sensitive user data, particularly authentication credentials, poses a significant security risk. Even if not directly exfiltrated by the application, such local storage can lead to severe compromise if the affected files are accessed or shared, potentially enabling unauthorized access to user accounts and services.

#### Vulnerability Details

A critical vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-54120**, has been discovered in **PCL (Plain Craft Launcher) Community Edition**. This issue, assigned a **CVSSv4 base score of 9.3 (Critical)**, revolves around the insecure handling of sensitive user data.

The vulnerability affects PCL Community Edition versions **2.12.0-beta.5** through **2.12.0-beta.9**. The technical cause stems from the application inadvertently writing **third-party login credentials** (e.g., Minecraft account details) directly to a **local log file** during the authentication process.

Although the log file is not automatically uploaded or shared by the application, the presence of these credentials in plaintext within a locally accessible file creates a significant exposure risk.

#### Potential Risks

The primary risk associated with this vulnerability is the **exposure of sensitive login credentials**. If a user manually shares the log file, or if an attacker gains local access to the user's system (e.g., via malware, physical access), the credentials can be easily retrieved. This can lead to:

*   **Account Compromise:** Attackers can use the exfiltrated credentials to gain unauthorized access to the user's associated third-party accounts, such as their Minecraft account.
*   **Further Attacks:** Compromised accounts can be used to launch further attacks, manipulate game servers, or gain access to other services if credentials are reused.
*   **Privacy Breach:** Sensitive personal information related to user accounts can be exposed.

#### Recommendations

**For Users/Site Owners:**

*   **Immediate Update:** Users are strongly advised to update PCL Community Edition to version **2.12.0-beta.10** or newer as soon as possible. This version contains the patch for this vulnerability.
*   **Log File Deletion:** After updating, users should locate and delete any log files generated by affected versions of PCL CE to ensure no sensitive data remains on their system.
*   **Password Reset:** It is recommended to change the passwords for any third-party accounts whose credentials may have been logged by the vulnerable versions of the software.

**For Developers:**

*   **Secure Credential Handling:** Never log sensitive information, especially authentication credentials (usernames, passwords, tokens), to log files or any form of persistent storage in plaintext.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that only strictly necessary data is processed and stored.
*   **Secure Logging Practices:** Implement robust logging practices that exclude sensitive data. If logging is required for debugging, ensure sensitive data is redacted or encrypted, and only stored temporarily in a secure manner.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and remediate similar data exposure vulnerabilities.
