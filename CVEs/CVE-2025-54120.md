## Plain Craft Launcher CE: Local Credential Logging Vulnerability

The accidental logging of sensitive **login credentials** in application log files poses a significant security risk, as highlighted by a recent critical vulnerability discovered in Plain Craft Launcher (PCL) Community Edition. Such issues can lead to severe **data exposure** and **unauthorized access** if these logs are inadvertently shared.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-54120`
*   **Affected Software:** PCL (Plain Craft Launcher) Community Edition
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions `2.12.0-beta.5` through `2.12.0-beta.9`
*   **Technical Cause:** During the **third-party login process**, PCL Community Edition incorrectly records the user's **login credentials** directly into a **local log file**.
*   **Impact:** While the log files are not automatically uploaded or shared by the application, a user who manually sends or shares these log files (e.g., for support or troubleshooting) risks exposing their sensitive **login credentials**. This can directly lead to **unauthorized access** to their Minecraft accounts and potentially other linked services, resulting in **data exposure** and **account compromise**.
*   **Severity:** This vulnerability is rated with a CVSS Base Score of `9.3`, classifying it as **CRITICAL**.

### Recommendations

*   **For Users and Site Owners:**
    *   Immediately update PCL Community Edition to **version 2.12.0-beta.10** or newer to mitigate this vulnerability.
    *   Refrain from manually sharing application log files, especially if you have used an affected version of the software. Consider deleting old log files after updating, if appropriate for your environment and without losing critical troubleshooting data.
*   **For Developers:**
    *   Never log sensitive information, such as **login credentials**, in plaintext or any easily recoverable format.
    *   Implement robust credential handling and secure logging practices, ensuring that PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and authentication secrets are appropriately protected and excluded from logs.
