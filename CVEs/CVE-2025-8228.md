## Urgent Security Advisory: Critical SSRF in ChanCMS Affects Versions Up To 3.1.2

A newly discovered critical vulnerability in **yanyutao0402 ChanCMS** poses a significant risk to organizations utilizing this content management system. Exploitation of such flaws can lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, sensitive data exposure, and potential compromise of your entire digital infrastructure, severely impacting business operations and financial stability.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-8228**
*   **Affected Software:** **yanyutao0402 ChanCMS**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including **3.1.2**.
*   **Technical Cause:** This vulnerability, classified as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), exists within the `getPages` function in the `/cms/collect/getPages` file. The issue arises from insufficient validation of the `targetUrl` argument. An attacker can manipulate this argument to force the ChanCMS server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external systems, bypassing typical firewall restrictions.
*   **Example Path (Conceptual):**
    ```
    POST /cms/collect/getPages
    Body: {"targetUrl": "http://internal-host:port/admin"}
    ```
    This example illustrates how an attacker could provide an internal URL for the `targetUrl` parameter, causing the ChanCMS server to connect to an internal administration panel.

### Risk Description

Successful exploitation of this Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability allows an attacker to compel the ChanCMS server to initiate connections to arbitrary URLs. This capability can be leveraged to:

*   **Scan internal networks** for other vulnerable systems or open ports.
*   **Access sensitive internal services or data** that are not directly exposed to the internet.
*   **Bypass firewall rules** and network segmentation, potentially gaining a foothold deeper within your network.
*   **Retrieve sensitive information** from internal APIs or databases that are only accessible from within the network.
*   **Potentially launch further attacks** against internal infrastructure.

### Who is at Risk

Organizations and individuals using **yanyutao0402 ChanCMS** versions **3.1.2** or older are immediately at risk. Any publicly accessible instance of ChanCMS within this version range is a potential target.

### Recommendations

**For Website Owners and Administrators:**

*   **Immediate Update:** Upgrade your **yanyutao0402 ChanCMS** instance to version **3.1.3** or later without delay. This is the most crucial step to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Temporary Mitigation (if unable to update immediately):** If an immediate update is not possible, implement network access controls (firewall rules) to restrict outbound connections from your ChanCMS server to only necessary external resources. You could also temporarily block access to the `/cms/collect/getPages` endpoint if its functionality is not critical to your operations. However, updating remains the primary and most effective recommendation.

**For Developers (of ChanCMS or similar applications):**

*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation and sanitization for all user-supplied URLs or network-related inputs.
*   **Whitelist Approach:** Instead of blacklisting malicious patterns, restrict `targetUrl` parameters to a predefined list of allowed hosts or IP ranges.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Protocols:** Ensure that the underlying HTTP client library used by the server cannot be coerced into using file, gopher, or other dangerous protocols that might expose internal files or services.
