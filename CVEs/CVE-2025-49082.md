## Security Advisory: Vulnerability in Absolute Secure Access Management Console (**CVE-2025-49082**)

Organizations rely on secure access solutions to protect their critical systems and data. A newly discovered vulnerability in the **Absolute Secure Access** management console could expose sensitive internal settings, even when specific access restrictions are in place. Understanding this flaw is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your network infrastructure.

### Vulnerability Details

A security vulnerability, identified as **CVE-2025-49082**, has been discovered in the management console of **Absolute Secure Access** software.

*   **Affected Software:** Absolute Secure Access
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to **13.56**
*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-49082**
*   **Technical Cause:** This flaw allows an attacker who already possesses administrative access to the console, and who has been assigned a specific set of permissions, to bypass those very permissions. This bypass enables them to improperly read other system settings that should otherwise be restricted. The attack is straightforward to execute, requires high privileges (existing administrative access), and does not need any user interaction to succeed.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** `5.1` (Medium severity)
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:N/MSA:N/S:N/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X`

### Risk Description

If exploited, **CVE-2025-49082** could allow an authenticated administrator to gain unauthorized visibility into configuration settings that their assigned permissions should restrict. While the immediate impact on overall system confidentiality is considered low, any unauthorized access to settings, even if not directly critical data, can expose internal system architecture or operational details that could be leveraged for further, more significant attacks.

### Who is at Risk?

Any organization or individual using **Absolute Secure Access** for network management and secure access control is at risk if they are running an affected version of the software. This specifically applies to systems where the management console is deployed and actively used.

### Recommendations

Taking prompt action is essential to mitigate this vulnerability.

*   **For IT Teams and Administrators:**
    *   **Immediate Update:** The most critical step is to immediately update your **Absolute Secure Access** installations to version **13.56** or later. This patched version directly addresses the vulnerability.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Continuously review and enforce the principle of least privilege for all administrative accounts. Ensure that even high-privileged users only have access to the specific settings and functions absolutely necessary for their role.
    *   **Monitor Logs:** Maintain vigilant monitoring of access logs for the **Absolute Secure Access** management console for any unusual activity, especially related to permission changes or unauthorized access attempts.

*   **For Software Vendors/Developers (Absolute):**
    *   Continue to implement robust input validation and authorization checks to prevent similar permission bypass issues in future releases.
    *   Ensure that security updates are clearly communicated and easily deployable for users.
