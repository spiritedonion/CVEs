## New Vulnerability Discovered in Optimizely Episerver CMS: Immediate Action Required

A newly identified security vulnerability in the **Optimizely Episerver Content Management System (CMS)** poses a risk of unauthorized code execution within your organization's content platform. This type of vulnerability, known as **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, could allow attackers to compromise user sessions, steal sensitive data, or manipulate website content, leading to significant financial and reputational damage.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-27800**
*   **Affected Software:** **Optimizely Episerver CMS**
*   **Affected Versions:** This vulnerability impacts specific versions of the Episerver CMS Core and UI components:
    *   **Episerver CMS 11.X:** **EPiServer.CMS.Core** versions prior to `11.21.4` (when used with **EPiServer.CMS.UI** versions prior to `11.37.5`).
    *   **Episerver CMS 12.X:** **EPiServer.CMS.Core** versions prior to `12.22.1` (when used with **EPiServer.CMS.UI** versions prior to `11.37.3`).
*   **Technical Cause:** This is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. An authenticated attacker, possessing administrative rights such as "WebAdmin," can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Notes" gadget located on the Episerver Admin dashboard. When a victim (e.g., another administrator) subsequently visits the dashboard, this malicious code is executed in their browser.
*   **Example Payload Type:** An attacker could embed arbitrary JavaScript code, such as `<script>alert('Malicious Code Executed');</script>` or more sophisticated scripts designed for data theft, directly into the "Notes" field. This code is then stored by the CMS and executed upon page load for any user viewing the affected notes.

### Risk Description

While requiring prior authentication, the successful exploitation of this **Stored XSS** vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

*   **Impersonate Administrators:** Gain unauthorized control over administrative sessions, enabling them to perform actions as the compromised user.
*   **Steal Sensitive Data:** Exfiltrate session cookies, user credentials, or other confidential information accessible within the administrator's browser.
*   **Deface or Manipulate Content:** Alter website content, redirect users to malicious sites, or inject malware into the CMS, impacting your brand and user trust.
*   **Further Attacks:** Potentially pivot to other systems or launch more sophisticated attacks from within the compromised CMS environment.
The CVSS Base Score for this vulnerability is 4.6 (Medium), but the potential business impact due to an administrator compromise should not be underestimated.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization utilizing **Optimizely Episerver CMS** is at risk if running the affected **CMS 11.X** or **CMS 12.X** versions detailed above. Systems where administrative users frequently access the dashboard and utilize features like the "Notes" gadget are particularly susceptible.

### Recommendations

To protect your systems and data, immediate action is strongly advised:

*   **For Website Owners/Admins:**
    *   **Urgent Update:** Prioritize applying the latest available patches and update your **Optimizely Episerver CMS Core** and **Episerver CMS UI** to the recommended secure versions (or newer) as soon as possible.
    *   **Monitor Activity:** Implement robust logging and monitoring for suspicious activity, especially concerning administrator accounts and unauthorized content modifications.
    *   **Educate Users:** Remind administrative users about the risks of interacting with unexpected or suspicious content, even within trusted applications.
*   **For Developers/IT Teams:**
    *   **Patch Immediately:** Update **EPiServer.CMS.Core** to `11.21.4` (or higher for CMS 11.X) and `12.22.1` (or higher for CMS 12.X). Similarly, update **EPiServer.CMS.UI** to `11.37.5` (or higher for CMS 11.X) and `11.37.3` (or higher for CMS 12.X).
    *   **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** For any custom modules or extensions, ensure all user-supplied input is rigorously validated on the server-side, and all output rendered to HTML is properly encoded to prevent similar XSS vulnerabilities.
